A LITTLE GIRL IN OLD WASHINGTON.

CHAPTER I.<br />
<br />

<span class="s08">A NEW HOME.</span>
</h2>

<p>
"But you will have to take sides," declared Jaqueline
Mason, "and it would be ungrateful if you did not
take our side. You are going to live here; you really belong
to us, you know. Your mother was own cousin to
our dear mother, and Patty was named after her&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I don't see why I should be called Patty when you've
given up Jack and make such a fuss!" interrupted a slim,
unformed girl, who was nearly as tall as the first speaker.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Miss Patty, I am sixteen and in long gowns;
and next winter I expect to go to balls and parties, and
be presented at the White House. Oh, I wish it was a
court!"
</p>

<p>
A young fellow, astride the low window seat, laughed
with a teasing, bantering sound in his voice, and his deep
eyes were alight with mirth.
</p>

<p>
"You think you are a great patriot, Jacky, but you
hanker after the fleshpots of Egypt and royalty, when we
have fought for our freedom and gained our independence
and set a noble example to the downtrodden nations of
Europe. Sighing for a king and a court!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not sighing. One can think of a thing without
wishing it&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And he called you Jacky!" cried Patty, with a certain
triumph ringing in her tone.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_2' name='Page_2'>[2]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Father said you were not to." Jaqueline Mason
raised her head with dignity. "I used to think it rather
funny when I was romping round, and it teased Aunt
Catharine; but I hate it now, and I've given up romping.
There is a great difference."
</p>

<p>
"And Cousin Annis is eager to hear about <i>her</i> side.
You hardly know which side you are on yourself."
</p>

<p>
She gave him a withering look, and turned to the little
girl who stood in a shrinking attitude, and whose eyes
had a certain lustrousness, as if tears were in their limpid
depths.
</p>

<p>
"I wish you wouldn't interrupt, Louis Mason! I am
trying to explain. Grandfather Floyd isn't our very own
grandfather&mdash;he married grandmother&mdash;and he believes
we shouldn't really have separated from England, or at
least we should have modeled our government upon hers
and had a king. He thought Washington ought to have
stood up for some grandeur and state, and he is afraid
now we shall all go to ruin. He never did like President
Jefferson. But you are too little to understand politics,
Annis, and I was going to explain&mdash;father and Aunt
Catharine are <i>own</i> brother and sister; then there are five
Floyd children, uncle and aunt's too. You really are not
related to them. You are on our mother's side."
</p>

<p>
"Jaqueline, you will be qualified to write the genealogy
of Virginia," and Louis laughed mockingly.
</p>

<p>
The girl colored with vexation. "Well, everybody
is married to almost everybody else; and now your mother
has married our father, and that in a way makes us
sisters."
</p>

<p>
The little girl standing by the window, where the sunshine
sifted flecks of gold through the green clustering
vines, looked up wistfully. She had wished out in Kentucky
that she had a sister, and now that three had welcomed
her and taken possession of her, she was not sure
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_3' name='Page_3'>[3]</a></span>
that she wanted sisters. She had slept with Varina, who
was about her own age, but who had not taken to her
very cordially. There was a still younger child, a boy,
curled upon the next window ledge, poring over an old
copy of Froissart, dog-eared and well worn. Varina was
petting two doves, who arched their necks and strutted
about.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, people get queerly married, up or down or crosswise.
I mean to marry someone quite new and strange.
But we were glad that father chose a cousin of our own
dear mother's, and I am sure we shall all like her. What
do you suppose they are about! Why don't they come
to breakfast?"
</p>

<p>
This was the great dining room. Four windows faced
the east, two the south, shaded by the wide porch roof
and the vines. There was a massive sideboard and a
china closet with glass doors, wherein were many family
heirlooms. The antlers and head of a great buck were
suspended over the mantel, which was graced by a pair of
silver candlesticks with several branches and a snuffers
and tray. There was a large, roomy sofa and some high-backed
chairs, quite stiff enough for the dames of early
eighteen hundred. The floor was bare, but laid with
various-colored woods. It had a hospitable air, altogether,
in spite of its massive furnishing. The table
was set for breakfast, and a tall silver coffee urn graced
one end of it.
</p>

<p>
There was a stir in the hall, and the sound of servants'
voices mingling with a mellow masculine greeting. The
little girl made a rush for her own dear mother, and ran
into Chloe, but her new father rescued her from harm,
since the woman was carrying a dish of savory fried fish,
followed by other servants with numerous viands.
</p>

<p>
He lifted her in his arms and kissed her, and her
mother bent over to give her another caress. Then
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_4' name='Page_4'>[4]</a></span>
he stood her down, and she almost buried her face in her
mother's gown and impeded her progress.
</p>

<p>
"Well, chicken," and the round, cheery voice sounded
as if a laugh was at the back of it, ready for the slightest
provocation, "how does it seem with all these brothers
and sisters? For that's what you are to be. Children,
here is your new mother, by daylight. Take a good look
at her and love her, though she will be more like a big
sister than a mother. I could have been her father. For
when I first saw her she was no older than you, Patty."
</p>

<p>
The children thronged about her. Second marriages
were quite common occurrences, and the children of those
days were expected to accept and make the best of them.
Miss Catharine Mason had taken excellent care of her
brother's household, and now gone to Williamsburg to
take charge of the Rev. William Conway's rectory and
be a mother to the three children. There had been a governess,
a certain Miss Betts, from farther North, who
somehow could not easily adapt herself to Southern ways,
and a rather turbulent household. There had been numerous
complaints, and at the summer vacation she had resigned.
Miss Jaqueline had in a measure taken the head
of the house, with Maum Chloe and Mammy Phil, who
had brought up the younger part of the flock and comforted
the elders in times of difficulty and trouble.
</p>

<p>
The new mother held out her arms. Jaqueline and
Patty gave her a warm embrace. Louis shook hands with
the grace of a gentleman, and smiled out of fine soft-brown
eyes. A very good-looking young fellow of
eighteen, home from his first college year.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, children, I hope you will all love me, for I have
had a sad, lonely time for the last five years. It seems
so good to get to a real home, and have a corner in your
father's big heart. And we will all try to make each other
happy."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_5' name='Page_5'>[5]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
She was rather tall and slim, this new Mrs. Mason, with
light-brown hair and blue eyes, and a sweet, wistful smile.
Nine years before this, she and her husband and baby had
gone out to Kentucky with a colony, and though the valley
was extraordinarily beautiful and fertile they had
known many hardships and more than one Indian skirmish.
Still, they were young and happy and prospering
when death came to Philip François Bouvier, and for five
years she had been full of perplexity and sorrow, when
the coming of her dead cousin's husband had brought
a glimpse of rest and the proffer of a haven of
delight.
</p>

<p>
"And this little one." She reached out her hand to
Varina. "You and Annis cannot be far apart in age, and
will be excellent friends, I trust. Was there not&mdash;"
glancing around.
</p>

<p>
"Charles, put up your book and come and speak to your
new mother. And then to breakfast. I shouldn't blame
Chloe if she put us on short commons this morning, we
are shamefully late. Your mother and I had several points
to discuss. We will do better to-morrow, Chloe. I hope
you have not allowed these marauders to tear down the
house nor tear up the garden. Ah, good-morning,
Homer."
</p>

<p>
Homer was the tall, stately major-domo. The Indian
blood in his veins showed in his erect stature, his straight
nose, and his hair, which, though quite frosty and curly,
was not kinky. And Homer felt as proud of his blood
as any of the Rolfe descendants.
</p>

<p>
They were all settled about the table presently&mdash;a household
to be proud of. Mrs. Mason took her place at the
urn; Annis had a seat beside her. Varina was on one
side of her father, Charles on the other. A fine-appearing
flock, truly; Jaqueline and Patricia giving promise of
much beauty. Louis was tall and manly, though one
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_6' name='Page_6'>[6]</a></span>
could see he had been bitten with the follies of early youth
by a certain aspect of finery that young men affected.
</p>

<p>
The meal was long and entertaining to the partakers.
There was so much to tell. Many things had happened
in the six weeks' absence of the head of the house, and
everybody running wild. True, the overseer was a man
of judgment and foresight, and of wide experience, and
the estate had not suffered. Chloe had managed to keep
what she called the "whip hand" of the house servants.
It was the children who had suffered most. Indeed, if
Aunt Catharine could have looked upon them now she
would have thought them demoralized beyond redemption.
</p>

<p>
But Squire Mason was an easy-going man, and had
a feeling that most things come out right if you give
them a chance. Prosperity is apt to make one buoyant
and cheerful. And though the country was in a bad way
and the rulers in high places were disputing as to whether
it could hold together, and there were no end of sinister
predictions even among those who had borne the strain
and burden of making a country. But crops had been
excellent, and on the large estates everything needful was
raised, so there was no stint. The Virginia planter, with
his broad acres, had a kingdom in virtue of this plenteousness.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Mason watched the two chattering girls, the little
Varina, who held whispered confidences with her father,
the abstracted boy Charles, surprising herself with a
sort of desultory conversation with the young man who
was explaining the many changes in men and events and
places in nine years.
</p>

<p>
"And we have brought the Capitol to Washington,"
he said, with the dignity of his eighteen years. "You
know there was a tremendous attempt to locate it at Baltimore."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_7' name='Page_7'>[7]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Yes. Baltimore is dear to me. All my young life
was passed there."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose there were some good reasons, but we
Southerners made a grand fight. We had Mr. Jefferson
on our side. I think Virginia never had full credit for
her brave share of the war. At all events we had the
crowning victory, the surrender of Cornwallis."
</p>

<p>
"I have quite a desire to see Washington."
</p>

<p>
"It is so hard to get grants to go on with the buildings
and improvements. The country ought to have more
enthusiasm. But the eastern States are not over-cordial
yet. Why, there could have been next to nothing done
when you went away!"
</p>

<p>
"There had been some trouble with Major l'Enfant,
I believe. And everybody was counting on a fortune for
the ground."
</p>

<p>
"As they are yet," and the young man laughed.
"Father has a tract of swamp and elder bushes. When
the streets reach out to us and the population increases,
we may go in. At least some of us younger ones. I don't
suppose anything would induce father to give up the
estate here?"
</p>

<p>
"You are right there, Louis. This old Randolph place
will last my time out," said his father, who had caught
the last of the sentence. "We are near enough, and can
get over to see the shows, while we keep out of the quarrels.
Some day it will be a fine town, and the country
at large may be proud of it. But there must be no end
of money sunk in the bogs. We will go over and inspect
it."
</p>

<p>
"I hope Mrs. Madison finds more for her comfort than
Mrs. Adams did," said Mrs. Mason, with a smile. "I
can appreciate pioneer life."
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Madison isn't lady of the White House absolutely,
but she is sent for to receive everybody. And she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_8' name='Page_8'>[8]</a></span>
entertains delightfully herself. You know," Jaqueline
said this to her new mother, "that Aunt Jane lives in the
City&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"She has not yet made Aunt Jane's acquaintance, or,
if she did, it was when Aunt Jane was a mere child. You
were here on a visit&mdash;when, Patricia?"
</p>

<p>
"Just before I was married, fifteen years ago, or nearly.
And Jaqueline was a little yellow-haired baby."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, how queer!" cried Patty.
</p>

<p>
"You see, mother was a widow some years, and her
second family is still quite young. Yes, Jane has married
very well, a surveyor and civil engineer. But it will not
do for us to sit over the breakfast table all day if we are
going to mother's," and the squire rose, pulling himself
together with a sort of shake.
</p>

<p>
"Must we go to-day?" Mrs. Mason's voice was beseeching.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, mother would consider it an unpardonable slight!
She is a great stickler for deference and attention, and all
that. Yes, and it is a good long drive. We can return
home by moonlight, however." He was coming around
to his wife's side. "We must take this little one and
show her to her grandparents. Rene, do you not want to
go along?"
</p>

<p>
Varina looked undecided. She was not quite sure she
wanted a new sister so near her own age. She had been
the pet and the plaything of the household, and last
night Mammy Phillis went over to the newcomer, who
had gone to bed for the first time in her life without being
cuddled by her own dear mother.
</p>

<p>
The squire pinched his new little girl's cheek softly.
She leaned it gently down in the hollow of his hand in
a mute caress. He was very fond of children.
</p>

<p>
There was the confusion of everyone rising, and all
of them talking at once, it seemed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_9' name='Page_9'>[9]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
After her good night's sleep and her week of happiness
Mrs. Patricia Mason looked both young and pretty,
though now she was not much past two-and-thirty.
</p>

<p>
"I want to ride over," declared Jaqueline; "I have not
been in ever so long. And Marion is to have a party on
her birthday, early in September. What a pity Louis will
be gone! She's desperately sweet on Louis."
</p>

<p>
The young man flushed scarlet.
</p>

<p>
"You can't marry your aunt any more than you can
marry your grandmother," said his father in a teasing
tone.
</p>

<p>
"Jack is always thinking about marrying," flung out
the brother. "It's a nasty way girls have."
</p>

<p>
"There! there! No disputing, or the new mother will
think she has fallen into a hornets' nest. Go and get
ready. I'll take a glance at the stables and see Dixon
for a moment," and he turned away. But Louis caught
his arm and kept step with him.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what is it?" he asked rather impatiently.
"Money again? You young people think the well is
exhaustless."
</p>

<p>
"No, it isn't money." His tone was a little husky.
"Jerry is lame. I rode him rather hard one day&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The squire smothered an oath. He had promised his
young wife he would not swear at everything. It <i>was</i> a
bad habit, a bad example to his boys.
</p>

<p>
"How did that come about? I told you Jerry was not
to be taken on tramps. You young fellows have no
sense."
</p>

<p>
"I was over to Kenyon's one day. They bet her
against Kenyon's mare. I tried to get out of it&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And you were beaten! Served you right! My poor
Jerry!" with a touch of desperate anger in the tone.
</p>

<p>
"No, I won!" There was a ring of elation in the
young voice. "He came in five seconds ahead. There
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_10' name='Page_10'>[10]</a></span>
was a great time, you may be sure, and Kenyon was for
trying it again. He thinks nothing can beat the mare.
I think Jerry trod on something. His foot and leg have
been swollen. Cato has him almost well, though."
</p>

<p>
"I meant to keep shady and enter him next year. I
do believe if you hadn't beat I should just take it out of
your hide," and the squire laughed. "Now it will go
abroad that I have a crack horse. Well&mdash;and what did
Cato say?"
</p>

<p>
"He was lame the next morning, but Cato thought it
wouldn't be much, and when he grew worse Cato worked
over him faithfully. He is sure he will be all right."
</p>

<p>
"You are beginning early, young man. Next time
you let my especial horse alone. Well, I'm glad it's no
worse. But I won't have you turning out a horse
jockey."
</p>

<p>
They had reached the stables, where two or three old
men and half a dozen negro boys were making a pretense
of being busy, but they rushed to welcome the
squire. Cato and Jerry were both interviewed, and when
the master emerged with a pleasant face and scattered a
handful of coppers for the small fry to chase about,
Louis felt quite relieved, for, truth to tell, he had had several
rather wretched days about his father's favorite.
</p>

<p>
The squire ordered up the carriage, and Julius came
down with missy's commands.
</p>

<p>
Annis had followed her mother up the broad staircase
to the large, light room where a slim young colored girl
was putting away various articles in drawers and closets.
The small wardrobe had been increased during the brief
time spent in Baltimore, but was not very extensive
yet.
</p>

<p>
When Randolph Mason had gone to Baltimore to settle
the estate of one of his wife's cousins, as he had been
named executor, he found Patricia Bouvier mentioned
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_11' name='Page_11'>[11]</a></span>
among the heirs. He recalled the pretty, attractive girl
his wife had taken such an interest in, who had married
an enthusiastic young French Huguenot, and some time
after joined a colony of emigrants to the "New Countries,"
as the Middle West was then called.
</p>

<p>
"She was left a widow some years ago," said one of
the relatives. "She did write about coming back, but
it is a long journey for a woman and a little child. Latterly
we have not heard. I dare say she is married
again."
</p>

<p>
There was a company going out to settle some boundary
question and make surveys, and on the spur of the
moment the squire's adventurous blood was roused and
he joined them. They had magnificent summer weather,
and his enjoyment was intense. He found the little settlement
and Mrs. Bouvier, who had known varying fortunes
since her husband's death. She had been kindly
cared for, and more than one man would gladly have
married her, but her heart yearned for her own people.
To take the journey alone seemed too venturesome, and
she well knew the perils of frontier travel. So she had
waited with a longing soul for some deliverance. She
would go back gladly.
</p>

<p>
There was no difficulty in disposing of her claim in
the settlement. She bade good-by to the grave it had
been a sad, sweet pleasure to tend, and with her little girl
and her delightful guide and convoy set out on the
journey.
</p>

<p>
Before they reached Baltimore a new tie had sprung
up between them. True, Squire Mason had thought occasionally
during the last year of marrying again. His
sister Catharine had said to him before her departure:
</p>

<p>
"The best thing you can do, Randolph, is to marry
soon. The girls will need someone to supervise them
and see that they make proper marriages. Mrs. Keen
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_12' name='Page_12'>[12]</a></span>
would be admirable, as she has no children. And there
are the Stormont girls; any of them would be suitable,
since even Anne is not young. I wish I had taken this
in hand before."
</p>

<p>
"I wish you were not going away, Catharine. My
girls ought to be nearer to you than Mr. Conway's," he
said ruefully.
</p>

<p>
"I will still do what I can for them. There is excellent
society at Williamsburg, and I can give them pleasant
visits. But I never saw a man more in need of a wife
than Mr. Conway. It's a good thing clergymen wear a
surplice, for I am sure he never could tell whether he was
decent or not. Surely it is a plain duty."
</p>

<p>
"And you leave me in the lurch?"
</p>

<p>
"But, you see, a clergyman needs a person well fitted
for the position, which, I must say, every woman is not,"
with an air of complacency.
</p>

<p>
"And you think anyone will do for me!"
</p>

<p>
"How foolish you are, brother! I think no such
thing. You certainly have sense enough to make a wise
choice."
</p>

<p>
But he had not chosen, and now he thought he should
like this sweet, sorrowful, tender Patricia. How bright
he could make her life!
</p>

<p>
He was so strong, so sincere and cheerful. He made
friends with shy Annis, who sat on his knee and was
intensely interested in his girls&mdash;he always called them
little. And before they reached Baltimore he had asked
Patricia to marry him, and Annis had consented to be his
little girl. Mrs. Bouvier's small patrimony was to be
settled on the child. But, then, she could not have imagined
Mr. Mason being mercenary.
</p>

<p>
Word had been sent to the household of the marriage.
They had not thought of objecting. In the great drawing
room there was a portrait of their mother in a white
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_13' name='Page_13'>[13]</a></span>
satin gown, with pearls about her neck. It had been
painted during a visit to London. They all went and
looked at it, and wondered if the cousin Patricia would
be anything like that!
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe she is as beautiful," declared
Jaqueline.
</p>

<p>
There had been several delays on the latter part of the
journey, and it was evening when the travelers reached
home. The welcome had been a hearty one, and when
supper was over Annis was nodding. It was past Varina's
bedtime. Charles had already stolen off.
</p>

<p>
"Take the children to bed, Phillis," said the master.
"They're to be sisters, so they may as well begin by sharing
the same room. You won't feel lonesome, little
Annis?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll go with her," said the mother in her soft voice.
</p>

<p>
"Nay." Randolph Mason put his hand on his wife's
arm and kept her a prisoner. "Phillie is the best of mammies.
And you belong in part to me. You have had a
hard time, and now there is someone to wait upon you
and ease you up. Good-night, little ones."
</p>

<p>
He kissed both children. Annis wanted to cling to her
mother, for even through these three days of her married
life her mother had heard her little prayer and put her to
bed, so she had not felt really separated. But when
Philly took her hand it came with a sudden wrench. She
dared not cry out in the face of them all. But, oh, was
her own dear mother not hers any more? Did she truly
belong to father Mason? And all these large children?
Had she given herself away when father Mason had put
a ring on her finger and called her his wife?
</p>

<p>
She was out in the hall&mdash;being led upstairs, and Phillis'
hand was as soft as a crumpled rose leaf. Her voice
was soft and sweet too. There were two small white-covered
beds, and when they were undressed and within
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_14' name='Page_14'>[14]</a></span>
them Phillis crooned a low melody, and the little girl, being
very tired and sleepy, forgot her sorrows.
</p>

<p>
Then in the morning Phillis came and dressed them
both and curled Annis' soft, light hair. Jaqueline seized
on her the moment she entered the breakfast room.
</p>

<p>
"I hardly had a look at you last night," she began.
"I do hope you won't feel strange and that you will like
us all. And there are ever so many other relations. Did
you never have any brothers or sisters?"
</p>

<p>
"No," answered Annis, with a kind of wistful regret,
raising her eyes shyly.
</p>

<p>
"We have another lot out at the Pineries. It's queer,
but we don't call them uncles and aunts, except Aunt
Jane, because she is married and the oldest. And we always
dispute&mdash;it's very funny and queer. Grandfather
is a Federal&mdash;well, a sort of Tory, too&mdash;and father's a Republican.
People who live in a republic ought to be
Republicans. That's what we fought for."
</p>

<p>
Annis stared. "Out home&mdash;there," indicating the
West with her head, "they fought the Indians."
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;it is all about the same thing, only there are
not many Indians around here. And we don't <i>fight</i> each
other."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know about that!" and the young man who
was toying with the ears of an English hound laughed.
</p>

<p>
Then had come the puzzling question, and Annis Bouvier
wondered what side she must take and was sadly
mystified.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_15' name='Page_15'>[15]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">THE PINERIES.</span>
</h2>
<p>
Annis ran and threw her arms around her mother's
neck and kissed her fervently.
</p>

<p>
"Are you glad to come here and do you like them
all?" she asked when she found her breath. "And it is
so queer, with all the black people and the great house and&mdash;and
everything!"
</p>

<p>
"It is a little strange. You will like it better by and
by," glancing tenderly down in her child's eyes.
</p>

<p>
"And you&mdash;must you be mother to <i>all</i> the children?
Am I never to have you any more?"
</p>

<p>
"You have me now. Yes, you will always have me.
Don't you remember you used to wish for a sister like
Sallie Reed? Her mother loved all the children."
</p>

<p>
"But she had them when they were cunning little
babies," was the decisive reply.
</p>

<p>
"Dear,"&mdash;her mother knelt down and put her arms
around the child,&mdash;"it is this way. We have come to this
lovely home which is to be ours, and all the pleasant
things a good friend can give&mdash;a kindly, generous friend.
I used to feel anxious and worried about your future.
There was no good school. The life was very narrow.
And if I had been taken away&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But they never would let the Indians take you. Oh,
mother dear!" with a fervent embrace. She had not
meant that, but she would not give the other explanation.
</p>

<p>
"And all these children are going to share their
father's love with you. He will give you this beautiful
home, clothe you, educate you, and he puts me in the
place of their dear mother who is dead. He is going to
care for me and keep me from toil and sorrows and perplexities.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_16' name='Page_16'>[16]</a></span>
When you are older you will understand better.
I hope you will try to love them all, and this good
dear friend who will be a father to you."
</p>

<p>
"But I shall love you the best."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, dear," with a proud certainty.
</p>

<p>
"And you will love me better than anyone else?" and
Annis clasped her mother with a child's unreasoning exclusiveness.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, dear."
</p>

<p>
A merry voice went lilting through the hall. Jaqueline
paused a moment at the door. She was in her pretty
green riding habit, and her straw hat had a bunch of iridescent
cock's-plumes. She held her riding whip in one
gloved hand, and she really was a picture good to look at.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, are you ready?" Mrs. Mason asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and the carriage has come, but father is still
down at the stables. Rene doesn't want to go, from some
queer freak, and Patty does. I don't believe father would
mind&mdash;would you?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course not," in a cordial tone.
</p>

<p>
"Rene is queer sometimes." Jaqueline studied Annis,
and smiled in an odd fashion, for Varina had just declared
she "wouldn't go anywhere with that new girl, and
that she did not mean to like her, for after all she was not
a real sister, and they had done very well without any
mother, and she just wished father had not brought her
home."
</p>

<p>
"It's the big carriage," said Patty, "and I could go if
Rene did not want to. I hate to stay home all alone."
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline understood that this would be the easiest
way of settling the matter, for Varina had a streak of obstinacy
that was conquered soonest by "giving her her
head," as Phillis said.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind about the box," as one of the men had
come in with hatchet and hammer. "I won't unpack it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_17' name='Page_17'>[17]</a></span>
this morning," began Mrs. Mason. "Is Patricia getting
ready?" She tied Annis' hat in a big bow under her chin,
and then putting on her own they walked downstairs
while Jaqueline went for Patty. Varina was nowhere to
be seen.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Mason had hardly noted her new home in the
dusk of the evening, except to be aware that it was very
large. The broad veranda was like a hall. Four fluted
columns ran up to the second-story windows, with vines
trained on trelliswork in between. The house had but
two stories, and an extensive observatory on the top that
really was a delightful room during the spring and
autumn. A lawn filled with clumps of shrubbery and
well-grown trees stretched down to the road, the drive
winding around in a half-curve. From the front there
was nothing to mar the handsome outlook where the
ground lay in a line of curves to the Potomac. The stables,
the workshops, and the negro quarters were cut off
by a tall, thick hedge.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Mason came around the corner of the house.
Jaqueline was feeding Hero lumps of sugar, to the amazement
of Annis. Patty flew across the veranda in a whirl,
and her father merely nodded to her explanations as they
were put on the back seat. Jaqueline waved her hand,
and Hero started off at a sharp canter.
</p>

<p>
Patty could not keep still very long, and began to
question Annis as to what the Kentucky home was like,
and if she was glad or sorry to leave it. There had been
only Seth Bowers, who worked the farm, and an Indian
woman to help about the house, but just across a little
yard space the Browns had lived, and beyond were the
stockade and the blockhouse. Then the log houses were
ranged around.
</p>

<p>
"But were you not afraid?" asked Patty. "Suppose
the Indians had come?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_18' name='Page_18'>[18]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"All the Indians about were friendly. We were not
afraid of them."
</p>

<p>
"But what did you spend your time at&mdash;if you didn't
go to school?"
</p>

<p>
"Mother taught me. Sally Brown came in when she
wasn't too busy, and we studied. Mrs. Brown spun and
knit, and Adam Dodge had a loom where he wove cloth.
Oh, there were a great many things!"
</p>

<p>
"A hard life it was for you," and Mr. Mason glanced
at his wife's countenance, which had fallen into thoughtful
lines.
</p>

<p>
"There have been many pioneers," she returned with a
half-smile. "Virginia is full of their graves. And the
northern coasts. Our people were wiser. They chose a
less rigorous clime."
</p>

<p>
"True. The story North and South is full of romance.
But, then, what country is not? The old Romans colonized,
sometimes very cruelly, tearing people from their
homes. We came of our free will, except such as were
redemptioners."
</p>

<p>
"And slaves," in a low tone.
</p>

<p>
"That is a serious question," and the squire's rugged
brows knit. "That they are better off is beyond cavil.
In their own land they fight and destroy each other, make
slaves, and many tribes are no doubt cannibals. The President
has always considered it bad for the country. But
we have needed labor. And in Bible times men were permitted
to enslave other nations. The dominant race gets
the upper hand, and it is right that knowledge and improvement
should have a chance against ignorance and
degeneracy. But this is a somber talk for such a fair day.
Look! Over yonder is the Capital."
</p>

<p>
She saw the gleam of the white buildings, and here and
there an imposing mansion. It was in truth a magnificent
day; the balmy breath of forests and the coolness of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_19' name='Page_19'>[19]</a></span>
the river tempering the heat. In and out by dainty edges
fringed with grasses, some standing sentinel-like, some
dallying coquettishly with the breeze, flowed the broad
river. There were innumerable little islets of rank greenness
looking as if they were set asail on its bosom, and
here and there a spike of blossom. All this great marsh
the hand of man and the wit of his brain were to transform
into one of the great cities of the world before the
century ended. Long, straight barren places were to be
beautiful streets, but now they were gray and dreary in
the sunshine. She liked the woods better, the winding
road that now was in a dense shade from the overarching
trees, and now came out to broad spaces of sunshine.
Squirrels chattered and ran about, whisking their feathery
tails like a fan; bird notes, clear and sweet, dying to most
exquisite softness, made melody in the air; bees hummed
and crooned, secure of their hidden sweets. Patricia
Mason drank it all in with a great feeling of gladness. It
was so unlike the primeval solitudes where the few clung
together, when the darkness fell, with a nameless terror,
or listened to the great shivering woods, wondering if an
enemy lay in ambush. God had watched over her and
her child and raised up kindly friends, and had now given
her home and rest&mdash;and, yes, love. How could she do
otherwise than love this large-hearted, generous man!
And she must train Annis to pay him something more
than mere respect.
</p>

<p>
The pretty young rider put her horse through his
various paces. Now and then she was lost to sight by
some turn in the road, then she waited with a laughing
face and paced demurely alongside of the carriage, chatting
gayly with her father or Patricia. She was not quite
at home yet with her new mother.
</p>

<p>
The day grew warmer. They drew up in a densely
shaded place.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_20' name='Page_20'>[20]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Let us get out and rest," said the squire. "There are
some fruit and a little luncheon, for we shall be late at the
Pineries. It is too warm to drive fast. But it will be delightful
coming back after sundown."
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline slipped off her horse. Patricia sprang out
with the litheness of a kitten. But the squire took Annis
in his arms and as he stood her down, kissed her, which
brought a quick blush to her cheek.
</p>

<p>
They found a fallen tree and a great flat rock that
looked as if Nature had set her table for travelers coming
by. They spread out their lunch. The girls had the
ready hunger of youth. Annis went round by her mother.
It was all so new and strange. She could not feel afraid
of this second father, and yet she did grudge his claim
upon her mother a little, the mother who was now in a
rather gay conversation with the two young girls. Jaqueline
<i>was</i> amusing in her descriptions of the Pineries, and
though her father checked her rattling tongue now and
then, she did not greatly heed it. Aunt Catharine had
been rather free in her strictures on people and events,
and the family at the Pineries had not escaped.
</p>

<p>
Then they resumed their journey, and the road grew
wilder. Washington and Georgetown were left behind,
the houses were less frequent, but the river still ran along
by their sides, and now and then a boat of some kind
passed them. Then they came to a clearing and a great
stretch of tobacco plantations, a winding drive through
giant pines that rustled like a river hurrying over a rocky
bed. In the midst of a woods, it seemed, so close were
the trees, with a fine open space in the front, stood the
mansion.
</p>

<p>
On the wide porch sat an elderly man with flowing
silvery hair, inclined to curl at the ends, but not fastened
in the fashion of the day. His frame was large, but one
could see there had been a gradual shrinking of the flesh,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_21' name='Page_21'>[21]</a></span>
for his face and his long thin hands were much wrinkled.
Still, there was a tint of pink in his cheeks, and his eyes
were very blue, rather piercing.
</p>

<p>
"Randolph Mason!" he exclaimed, standing his big
volume down on the porch floor and taking the flight of
steps deliberately. "This is indeed a surprise! You
have been a great truant, and I hope your quest was satisfactory.
When did you return? We have heard nothing
for at least a fortnight. Your mother was wondering&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Last night. I spent a few days in Baltimore. And I
have brought home a new wife, so we came at once to pay
our respects to my mother."
</p>

<p>
"Jack, summon Madam and Marian. Allow me to
give you congratulation," and he held out his hand to
Mrs. Mason with impressive dignity. "You will have a
good husband, madam, though we have for some time
considered him proof against woman's charms. But we
all succumb sooner or later. I was quite a bachelor when
Mrs. Mason conquered me. Jaqueline, how do you do?
And, Patricia? Why&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He stared at Annis.
</p>

<p>
"This is my new little daughter Annis Bouvier. We
have not had time to change her name yet. I found Mrs.
Bouvier without much difficulty, and persuaded her to
return to her relatives at Baltimore, and to the small fortune
awaiting her. There I suddenly was seized with a
new mind and persuaded her to marry me."
</p>

<p>
Squire Mason laughed with a kind of boyish gayety.
Mr. Floyd looked scrutinizingly at the two girls, as if
wondering how they had taken this unexpected new
mother. But the brilliant faces showed no disapprobation.
</p>

<p>
They had reached the porch, and the master rang his
bell loudly for some servants and began to berate them
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_22' name='Page_22'>[22]</a></span>
all for a lazy, worthless lot, pushing chairs hither and
thither and inviting the guests to be seated, and in the
midst of the confusion a dignified woman crossed the
room and came out to them.
</p>

<p>
Even now Madam Floyd, halfway between sixty and
seventy, was a fine, imposing woman, stately and rather
stout. Her petticoat of embroidered satin was displayed
by the skirt of her gown being drawn aside and edged
with lace that made cascades of the creamy stuff as she
walked. Her sleeves came to the elbows and her round
arms were white and plump, and the bit of neck left by the
stomacher of lace showed scarcely any sign of age. On
her head was a large turban-like cap of fine sheer muslin
much affected by the elderly woman of that time.
</p>

<p>
She was of course surprised at her son's marriage, and
said rather sharply that "it might have been done with
less haste," but to the new wife&mdash;"You will find men
have not over-much consideration. And I suppose it was
a matter of satisfaction to leave that wild land behind
you and return to the home of your childhood? But you
found many changes, doubtless. You were of the Moore
branch, I believe, kin to my son's first wife?"
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline and Patty had gone to hunt up Marian.
Dolly had gone off in the mountains visiting. So Madam
had the guest to herself, and between them they picked
out all the descent of the family from the coming of Lord
de la Ware down to the present time. Even the Huguenot
Bouvier was not wanting in good birth, so that matter
was satisfactorily settled. Then Madam bethought
herself that the travelers must have gone without dinner,
and ordered a table set out on the porch, with cold
chicken, tempting slices of fresh bread, and wine, and
gave charges for a high tea at an early hour, since the
guests had not come to stay.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Floyd and his stepson were already deep in politics
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_23' name='Page_23'>[23]</a></span>
and growing quite heated. The country was all astir,
as in the autumn there would be a Presidential election.
</p>

<p>
"There will be no chance for the Federals," said the
elder man sharply. "The President will have things all
his own way and put in his man, who, if he shilly-shallies,
as they have been doing, will give England another
chance. She beats us out of everything, you may as well
admit. And this embargo hasn't hurt her, and it will
not. There will be no French to call upon this time
for help. And you mark my words, we shall go back like
whipped hounds! I knew the Colonies never could hang
together. The East wants one thing, the middle
States another; and they demand the freedom of coming
in and regulating our affairs. No, there will never be a
settled peace until England has really conquered us and
put us back in our proper place."
</p>

<p>
Squire Mason laughed. "That will never be. We
have had too long a taste of freedom, of ruling ourselves.
And if we could not be conquered before, it would be the
wildest folly to attempt it now. Besides, she has her
hands full."
</p>

<p>
"She and the other nations will join to finish that upstart
Napoleon. And the country will be foolish enough
to just throw itself at her, and she won't take that! Two
kings can't govern a country, and we have a dozen different
kings, with their panaceas, and they have brought
the country to the verge of ruin. Washington had
some wisdom, I will admit, and Adams some sense, but
since then, with this half-infidel who believes in every man
having his own religion, and no state church to rally
about, and considers that one man has just as much
rights as another, and that drivel that all men are born
free and equal! They are not, I tell you. And I believe
in a state church and the power to make it respected."
</p>

<p>
"Don't get so excited, father," admonished his wife.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_24' name='Page_24'>[24]</a></span>
"Come, Randolph, have a bite of something and a glass
of wine. You must be half famished, Mrs. Patricia&mdash;the
name come in very handy, you see. And the little girl.
Annis is quite out of the family lines. I don't remember
hearing it. It has a Puritan sound. I think myself it is
a shame the world should be so mixed up on religion.
There is but one Bible, and there should be but one way,
and the scoffers and unbelievers be set by themselves."
</p>

<p>
"Where are the girls?" asked their father.
</p>

<p>
"They have looked up Marian, I dare say; and she has
Sukey Martin and two of the maids taking apart gowns
and fashioning them over in modern style. A friend sent
Jane some patterns from Philadelphia, and she passed
them on. Did you see much that was new in Baltimore,
Madam Patricia? Though this flightiness of dressing is
much to be deprecated, and fills the minds of young people
with vanity. But Jane has insisted that Marian shall
come and make her a long visit this winter. They are
to get in their new house in September. I do hope son
Jettson is not going on too fast."
</p>

<p>
"He may as well make the money as anyone," subjoined
grandfather. "The quicker they build up the
quagmire the better it will be for the permanency of the
Capital. And if some time those canting Puritans want a
separate government of their own, they can take New
York or Philadelphia for their center."
</p>

<p>
"They are improving rapidly," said the squire. "It
will be a fine city. Daniel Carroll's mansion is an ornament,
and the Van Ness house is planned for much gayety
and large companies. And there are many others in
process of erection."
</p>

<p>
Annis sat beside her mother and thought of the talk
with which the day began. If she had to take sides it
would be that of her new father, who was smiling and
good-humored and did not bring his fist down on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_25' name='Page_25'>[25]</a></span>
table or the edge of the chair with such a thump that it
frightened you. She did not like the grandfather, she decided.
Yet he was a handsome old man, with his ruffled
shirt front, his flowered waistcoat, his velvet smallclothes,
with silver buckles in a bow just below his knee
and others set with brilliants on his shoes.
</p>

<p>
The ladies discussed the bringing up and the education
of girls. They were to be good housewives, trained in
all useful arts, and their chief business in life was to
make good marriages. And Madam Floyd admitted that
she had sent Dolly away because there was an undesirable
in the neighborhood, a young Mr. Sears who had been
abroad and who played high and drank more than was
seemly&mdash;a degenerate son of a good family. Dolly was
very light and trifling.
</p>

<p>
"Catharine was a very good, steady girl, but her lover,
a most worthy young man, died, and she lost all heart for
gayety. And when I married Mr. Floyd"&mdash;she bent her
head over and spoke in a lower tone&mdash;"I thought he had
some feeling&mdash;men are given to jealousy, you know, and
as Catharine was fond of staying with her brother, and
the new family increased so rapidly that somehow we
were weaned away. I was almost struck dumb when she
came and told me about her marriage&mdash;a settled old maid
such as she was! However, I hope it is for the best,
and that really made it necessary for Randolph to
marry."
</p>

<p>
The men had gone at politics again.
</p>

<p>
"Marian and Dolly were too young to go and look after
such a family, even if their father would have spared
them. And I think my son has made a wise choice,
though I can't tell you how surprised I was, with no notice
beforehand."
</p>

<p>
"It was very sudden. I could not have done it with&mdash;with
a stranger," and Patricia colored. "I had been very
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_26' name='Page_26'>[26]</a></span>
fond of my cousin. And Mr. Mason was so kind, so
thoughtful&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"He and Catharine hardly seem like my children," and
their mother gave a faint smile. "I have been Mr.
Floyd's wife twenty-five years."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Floyd summoned a servant presently and said
she would show her new daughter the house, so they left
the men to their pipes and their disputes. The old house
had been built long ago and had many rare belongings,
for one ancestor had been a seafaring man and brought
home no end of curiosities. The wide hall went straight
through the middle, but the kitchens were not detached.
There were a great storeroom and linen press and bedding
chests crowded to the brim. Drawers were sweet
with napery laid in lavender and rose leaves. The very
air was delicious with old-time fragrance.
</p>

<p>
"In the new countries one has little time to lay up
stores," Madam said, "and I suppose there are no instructed
maids. It is the story of Jamestown and the
eastern Colonies over again. But we have been civilized
this many a year, and kept in touch with the mother
country as well, though I am not so sure that we would
be better off under her government. My forebears made
a brave struggle, and I would not have it go for nothing.
But one finds it idle work contradicting one's husband,"
and she smiled faintly. "There are ways to get along
more peaceably. Though it seems as if we may all go
to pieces yet."
</p>

<p>
She opened the next door, where three slaves were
spinning piles of carded wool for winter wear, and the
hum of the wheels had the rush of water over gentle descents.
Then they went up another broad staircase to the
sleeping chambers.
</p>

<p>
"My daughters will have a good outfit," she said
proudly. "Jane is a notable housekeeper and the others
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_27' name='Page_27'>[27]</a></span>
are being trained. A woman needs to know all suitable
things."
</p>

<p>
The sound of girls' voices and merry laughs reached
them, and Madam Floyd frowned sharply. They inspected
the sleeping chambers, where most of the furniture
was massive and dark with age, in vivid contrast to
white hangings and blue-and-white spreads.
</p>

<p>
When they went down to the drawing room Madam
Floyd sent a servant rather sharply for her daughter. A
young girl of nineteen or so entered with a somewhat
demure aspect.
</p>

<p>
"You seem to have forgotten your duty to your brother's
wife, Marian! I am ashamed of you, since you knew
she was here! Your head is so filled up with finery
there is no room for manners," the mother exclaimed
shortly.
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry. I thought you and my father would
want them both a while." She held out her hand to Patricia
and gave her a welcome and good-wishes.
</p>

<p>
"And now order the tea at once. Randolph thinks he
cannot remain all night, and it is a long ride home. But
it will be much pleasanter than the journey hither."
</p>

<p>
When they went out on the porch&mdash;where most of the
time was spent in the warm weather&mdash;they found the
men had gone to inspect the crops and the stock.
</p>

<p>
"You will find Randolph rather easy-going," Madam
Floyd said to her new daughter. "And the children have
grown quite lawless this year, though I cannot say Catharine
kept them with a firm hand. Those two have their
father's ways in a great measure. I hope you will not
find it too hard, Mistress Patricia, and in any perplexity
I will try to give you good counsel. I hope we shall be
the best of friends."
</p>

<p>
"I am thankful for your kindliness toward me," returned
the daughter-in-law. "I feel quite alone in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_28' name='Page_28'>[28]</a></span>
world. So many of the Baltimore cousins are dead. And
I lost my own mother when I was so young."
</p>

<p>
"The little girl seems a nice quiet child," the elder
said presently. "Girls are more manageable when they
are small, but troublesome enough when the time of lovers
begins."
</p>

<p>
Annis sat on the step watching the great peacock strutting
about and the meek peahens seemingly lost in admiration
of their lord's grandeur.
</p>

<p>
Then there was a bountiful supper and a fine ride home
in the moonlight and the deliciously fragrant air. Annis
leaned down on her new sister's shoulder and fell asleep.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">APPLES OF DISCORD.</span>
</h2>
<p>
It was very hard for Annis Bouvier to give up so much
of her mother. Her new father teased her a little, but
when he saw she was really pained and the tears came
into her eyes he would stop and give her a caress and a
kiss. He was a very kindly master, and the overseer
grumbled a little at times and made up by undue severity.
Then he certainly was an indulgent father. Patricia despaired
at times of establishing any authority.
</p>

<p>
The house was so large, the servants so numerous, the
confusion so great after the quiet life she had led in the
far-away settlement. And at first not a day passed without
some visitors, who came to pay their respects to the
new mistress. Jaqueline ordered her pony and rode off
with a mere announcement to anyone standing near. She
seemed to have no end of girl friends and was mostly a
law unto herself. She and her sister had numerous
squabbles that never degenerated into quarrels. Annis
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_29' name='Page_29'>[29]</a></span>
liked Patricia very much, but she and Varina looked
askance at each other, with considerable jealousy at the
bottom.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Jettson came over with her nurse and two babies,
and Annis was delighted with them.
</p>

<p>
"But they are not yours in any way," said Varina.
"They belong to us and Grandma Floyd."
</p>

<p>
"That is being a selfish little girl, Rene," said Aunt
Jane. "Annis is to be like a sister to you."
</p>

<p>
"But I don't want her for a sister. I have enough
sisters. She shall not ride on my pony nor feed my pigeons
nor have any of my books."
</p>

<p>
Annis' heart swelled within her.
</p>

<p>
"I don't want any of them," she made answer. "And
I wish mamma and I could go away. She belongs to me
and&mdash;and a little to your father, but most to me. But I
wish she didn't belong to any of you!" and the soft, deep
eyes overflowed with tears.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Annis! what is this all about?" Patricia flew in
and clasped the little girl in her arms in spite of a protest.
"I'm beginning to love your mother very much. You
see, she <i>does</i> belong to us, and now you can't take her
away. And we are glad to have you&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not glad." Varina stretched up every inch of her
size. "I'm sure we were well enough before."
</p>

<p>
"It's mostly Rene's dispute," began Aunt Jane.
"Annis was enjoying the babies. Come here, dear."
</p>

<p>
Annis rushed out of the room sobbing. Where was her
mother?
</p>

<p>
"Rene, you naughty little girl!" and Patricia gave her
a shake. "Why, Jane, we have all been getting along in
the very nicest manner. And <i>she's</i> just lovely. We
couldn't quite resolve at first whether we would call her
mother; but father wanted us to, and now it seems natural
enough. Louis likes her ever so much. And Jack says
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_30' name='Page_30'>[30]</a></span>
she's like a big sister. She's nicer than Aunt Catharine
was at the last, she fretted at us so. I hope her little
girls are pretty bad, and then she won't think we are the
worst."
</p>

<p>
Aunt Jane laughed. "I dare say Aunt Catharine will
have some trials. That is a funny wish. Rene, you must
learn to like this little girl. I think her very nice and
sweet. I shall ask her to come over and visit me."
</p>

<p>
"Then I won't come." Varina's eyes flashed.
</p>

<p>
"But why do you not like her?"
</p>

<p>
"She sits on father's knee, and&mdash;and Charles read to
her yesterday and showed her pictures in his book and
said she understood better than I did. And Mammy said
her hair was beautiful."
</p>

<p>
Varina began to cry.
</p>

<p>
"So her hair is beautiful," said Aunt Jane decisively.
"And perhaps she <i>is</i> smart. You are dull at your book,
Varina, and if you are going to be cross and jealous your
father will not like you. Fie, for shame!"
</p>

<p>
"If you are going to roar like the bull of Bashan you
will have to go upstairs by yourself. And I must find
little Annis," declared Patricia.
</p>

<p>
Annis had seen her mother walk down the path under
the mulberry trees, and she ran swiftly, sobbing as if her
heart would break with a strange, yearning homesickness
for the home in the forest and her mother all to herself
once more. Then she caught her foot in the root of a
tree that had pushed up out of the ground, but two
friendly arms clasped her, and sitting down on the bole
of a tree that had been sawed off to thin the dense shrubbery,
he held her tenderly.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, little Annis? What has happened to
you?"
</p>

<p>
"I want my dear mother," the child sobbed. "I want
her to go away and take me. I can't stay here. I'd rather
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_31' name='Page_31'>[31]</a></span>
have Sally Brown to play with, and the great woods.
I think I shouldn't even mind Indians, nor dark
nights."
</p>

<p>
"Has Charles been cross to you?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I like Charles. Let me go find mamma."
</p>

<p>
"You can't have her just now," said Louis in a soothing
tone. "Father has to have her on a little matter of
business."
</p>

<p>
"You <i>all</i> have her!" resentfully.
</p>

<p>
"That is because she is so charming and sweet."
</p>

<p>
Annis looked up into the face that was smiling and
sympathetic.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me the trouble. Surely Patty or Jacky have not
been scolding you? For you couldn't have done anything
bad. You are such a shy, quiet little thing."
</p>

<p>
"I was playing with the babies&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Surely it wasn't Aunt Jane?"
</p>

<p>
"No." She had stopped sobbing and raised her sweet
eyes, the tears still beading the lashes.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you want to go away, then?"
</p>

<p>
There was no answer. Did she really want to go?
The arm about her was very friendly. She had felt almost
afraid of this big brother, but his voice went to her
heart.
</p>

<p>
"I think we cannot spare you. I know we cannot
spare your mother."
</p>

<p>
"Annis! Annis!" called the clear girl's voice.
</p>

<p>
"Here, Patty," answered her brother, and the young
girl ran down to them. She smiled at Annis.
</p>

<p>
"What happened?" Louis asked.
</p>

<p>
"It was that little cat Rene! She didn't scratch,
though. Rene has been spoiled by everybody, and she
believes now that no one has any rights but herself."
</p>

<p>
"And we'll stand by Annis. Come&mdash;you do like us a
little, do you not?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_32' name='Page_32'>[32]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
He put both hands on her shoulders and smiled in a
very winsome manner.
</p>

<p>
"Of course she does." Patty stooped and kissed her.
"You must not mind Rene when she gets in a temper.
See, there's Jacky and I, two girls on your side, and Louis
and Charles, I am quite sure. Don't you know Jack told
you we were always taking sides?"
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;what will&mdash;Rene do?"
</p>

<p>
The tone was so half-reluctant, pity fighting against inclination,
that Louis could not forbear smiling while he
hugged her to his heart.
</p>

<p>
"Rene must be punished. It isn't the first time she has
been snappy, Louis. She quarreled with Charles the
other day because&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Patty finished the sentence with raising her brows and
making very big eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Because," said Annis in a low tone, "he was reading
to me and would not leave his book to go and play."
</p>

<p>
Annis looked very pretty with her downcast eyes and
the softened truth in her tone.
</p>

<p>
"Charles was a gentleman. All Virginia boys should
be. And now, little Annis, isn't it all made up? You
will not want to go away?"
</p>

<p>
"I like you both," Annis said simply.
</p>

<p>
"Come back and see the babies," and Patricia held out
her hand.
</p>

<p>
Louis bent down and kissed her. Of course no one
would ever grudge her any love, not even Rene when she
understood. It was a mere childish ebullition.
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline had come in and heard the story, and, as she
was quite accustomed to authority, Rene had been handed
over to Mammy Phillis with strict injunction to keep her
a prisoner for the next two hours. Jane had come out on
the lawn and little Floyd was rolling over the short turf
in the care of a laughing darkey boy, while Arthur lay on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_33' name='Page_33'>[33]</a></span>
his back crowing and chewing his fat fists for an interlude.
There was her mother with some needlework in
her hand, and Annis flew to her, hiding her face in the
little hollow between neck and shoulder, with a great
heart-throb of thankfulness.
</p>

<p>
No one remarked on Rene's absence at the dinner table.
It was a jolly family gathering, and there was a great
deal of talk about what was going on in the City and the
coming election and the return of Louis to college. Jaqueline
would go with him and pay Aunt Catharine her first
visit, that she was very urgent about. She missed the
young people sadly, she admitted.
</p>

<p>
They also discussed a tutor for the younger children.
Although education had not taken a very wide range for
girls as yet, the necessity was beginning to be felt.
Ministers appointed abroad would want intelligent wives,
and even now, in Washington, foreigners appeared in society,
and it was considered an accomplishment to talk
French and to be entertaining.
</p>

<p>
The elders went to take an afternoon nap, a favorite
habit with the squire when he could.
</p>

<p>
"Come," Charles said to Annis, "let us go down under
the pines and read," and she was nothing loath. The
old heroes of Froissart were like fairyland to the children.
Then there were marvelous pictures, the roughest kind of
woodcuts, but they picked out their heroes with great satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
Annis had seen few books. There were some old
French volumes belonging to her father, and Patricia had
begun to teach the little girl as a solace for her long and
often weary hours. This was a garden of delight, even
if Charles did puzzle over the long words and miscall
them.
</p>

<p>
Jane took Varina home with her, which was a great
source of elation after the enforced seclusion of the day.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_34' name='Page_34'>[34]</a></span>
She gave Annis an indifferent nod as she stepped into
the carriage.
</p>

<p>
"You must be a good little girl and mind Aunt Jane,"
said her father.
</p>

<p>
"Children's tiffs are natural," he remarked to his wife.
"Varina has been the baby so long she cannot tolerate a
rival. Years ago she crowded Charles out of his place."
</p>

<p>
He was not quite sure but the winsome little Annis,
with her shy sweet ways and ready interest, was the more
companionable. Yet he must not be disloyal to his own.
</p>

<p>
Were they all on her side? Annis wondered. And
would she need to take sides anywhere? She was very
happy and content. Louis took her out riding on Varina's
pony. She demurred at first, but the squire promised
to look up a suitable one for her in a day or two.
</p>

<p>
The new wife soon became settled in her agreeable surroundings.
She had not an aggressive nature, and the
house servants soon learned that her rule was not as severe
as Miss Catharine's, while quite as wise. She really
desired to win the affection of her husband's children.
Neighbors were near enough for pleasant rides and
drives. There was much hearty sociability among these
Virginian people. There had grown up a certain ease
and carelessness since the strenuous days of the war.
Though finances had been troublesome and grave questions,
as well as bitter disputes, had come to the forefront
of the young republic&mdash;in spite of all there had been a certain
degree of prosperity on the large estates, where nearly
everything was raised and much made for home consumption.
Georgetown was rather a thriving and fashionable
place. Bladensburg was quite a summer resort,
on account of a mineral spring many thought efficacious
for numerous diseases. Vessels laden with tobacco still
sailed from its wharves down the Anacostia. There was
the noted dueling-ground also, where proud-spirited men
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_35' name='Page_35'>[35]</a></span>
went to satisfy their "honor." Around, in many directions,
were handsome Colonial mansions with picturesque
grounds. Washington was slowly emerging from the
chaos of unfinished streets and buildings, but had not yet
outgrown the flings of the envious and disappointed.
The Capitol shone in its white glory. The President's
mansion was imposing and habitable, though, through
the administration, it had been graced largely by Mrs.
Madison, the charming wife of the secretary of state,
and one of her sisters.
</p>

<p>
When Annis Bouvier went over with her mother and
stepfather to bring home Rene, who had tired of the
babies and was longing for her pony and the larger liberty,
and, perhaps, her disputes with Charles and the teasing of
Louis, as well as the merriment of her sisters, the child
stared at the stately row of buildings that quite met her
idea of a palace. The long and wide avenues running off
into unfinished spaces, the trees already beginning to
make a brave show, the handsome dwellings here and
there were a fair augury of things to come, and seemed
wonderful to her. Out in the settlement it had been
vaguely speculated upon. Was it not a dream?
</p>

<p>
They drove about in some of the most passable streets.
People were out for an airing this pleasant afternoon;
numbers of men stood in groups in eager discussion, some
gesticulating quite as fiercely as Grandfather Floyd had
done. There were pretty young women on horseback,
with their attendant cavaliers, laughing and jesting, and
a few boys running about. The broad river, with its
curves, receiving in its bosom the springs and rivulets
and edged with swaying grasses topping into feathery
fronds, while multitudes of wild flowers sprinkled the
verdure that, from its moisture, still kept the greenness
and fresh aspect of spring.
</p>

<p>
"Now you can take a good look at everything," said
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_36' name='Page_36'>[36]</a></span>
the squire, leaning over to Annis. "We hurried through
so, and it was nearly dark when we came from Baltimore.
It is the palace of our republic."
</p>

<p>
Annis was to see it under various phases and to spend
a night of terror in it, then to watch it arise from the ashes
of destruction. But she could always recall this lovely
afternoon and the birds flashing hither and thither in
flame-color and gold&mdash;the Maryland yellow-throat, the
redbird, with his high cockade and his bold, soldier-like
air. Child as she was, the beauty of all things touched
her deeply, and she hardly heard Varina's chatter about
what she had done and where she had been, and the
spinet at Aunt Jane's house, "which I do think more refined
than a fiddle," declared the little miss disdainfully.
"A lady can play on it. Of course fiddling is the right
thing to dance by, and it seems proper enough for the
slaves. And some of the real elegant people come to
Aunt Jane's. Your mother hasn't any gown half as
pretty as they wear."
</p>

<p>
"No," returned Annis, without a touch of envy.
</p>

<p>
"Jaqueline is to have some new gowns to go to Williamsburg.
Oh, I just wish I was a big girl and could
have fine things! I hate being little! You get sent out
of the room when the ladies are talking, and you have to
go to bed early, and you can't come to the table when there
is company. I am going to try my very best to grow and
grow."
</p>

<p>
Annis wondered whether she would like being a young
lady. Jacky was nice, to be sure.
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline seemed to enjoy it very much. The new tutor,
who was a Mr. Evans, a young man, was to take
charge of the girls' studies, as well as those of Charles.
Patricia quite envied her sister, and declared French was
the greatest nuisance that had ever been invented.
</p>

<p>
"You don't invent a language," corrected Charles.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_37' name='Page_37'>[37]</a></span>
"It grows by slow degrees and is improved upon and
perfected&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It was just sent upon the world at the Tower of Babel,"
interrupted Patricia. "After all," laughing&mdash;and
a laugh always came to end Patty's spurts of temper&mdash;"it
must have been very funny. Think of a man asking for&mdash;what
were they building the tower out of? Bricks,
wasn't it? and water, and the other man not understanding.
And I suppose bread had a dozen new queer names,
and everything! What a jabber it was! And that's
where the languages came in, Master Charles," with a
note of triumph in her clear, breezy voice.
</p>

<p>
"Just wait until you study Latin and Greek!"
</p>

<p>
"Girls don't have to, thank fortune! The French will
destroy my constitution, and, unlike the United States, I
haven't any by-laws, so I shall be finished out."
</p>

<p>
"There have been some learned women and wonderful
queens."
</p>

<p>
"I can't be a queen. I don't want to. Think of poor
Marie Antoinette!" and Patty shivered. "I <i>might</i> marry
someone who would be President, but it is doubtful. No,
like Jacky, I shall go in for the good time."
</p>

<p>
Charles thought there was not much comfort talking to
girls, except Annis, who listened with attentive eyes, and
asked such sensible questions&mdash;as if she really wanted to
know things. The very first day the boy warmed to his
tutor, and Mr. Evans was quite delighted with this
small scholar. But, as the trend of the day was
then, he also had no very exalted opinion of girls, and
considered their highest honor that at the head of the
household.
</p>

<p>
The great trunk in the storeroom that Aunt Catharine
went through religiously once a year, to see that no corrupting
influences, such as moth or rust, should gain surreptitious
entrance, was to be opened now, and Jaqueline's
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_38' name='Page_38'>[38]</a></span>
portion of her dead mother's treasures bestowed
upon her. Aunt Catharine had divided them as equally
as possible, and done them up in separate parcels for each
girl. In her early married life Mrs. Mason had made a
visit to Paris, while Franklin was still abroad. There
had been a sojourn in London as well, and she had
brought home enough to last her brief life and to descend
to her children. Mrs. Conway specified which gowns
should be refashioned a little for her niece and what of
her mother's jewels it would be proper for her to wear.
Jaqueline would fain have confiscated all.
</p>

<p>
"Do as your aunt advises," said her father, with a sound
of authority in his tone not to be gainsaid. "She was
always a woman of good sense until she took up with
those ultra views of religion, and Conway. She was so
settled in her ways, too, that no one would have dreamed
it, either; but there's no telling what a woman will do
until she's past doing. And it's natural for them to
marry. But Catharine could have had her pick in her
youth. She held her head mighty high then."
</p>

<p>
There was no little confusion getting the two young
people ready. Louis brushed up some studies with Mr.
Evans, for his summer had been one of careless fun and
good-fellowship with the neighboring young men. Still,
he was ambitious to stand well and not drop behind his
last year's record. Then they had to go up and bid
grandmother good-by, and there were neighborhood gatherings
quite as important as if these young people were
going to the unexplored wilds of Africa.
</p>

<p>
Their departure made a sudden hiatus. With so
many people in the house and on the plantation, it did not
seem as if two could be so sincerely regretted. Every
slave, from Homer down to the rollicking pickaninnies,
bemoaned "Mas'r Louis"; and Mammy Phil, who had
nursed every one of the "chillens," had a double dose of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_39' name='Page_39'>[39]</a></span>
sorrow, and so many reminiscences that Patricia was
provoked.
</p>

<p>
"As if there were never any children in the world but
Louis and Jaqueline!" she flung out with some vexation.
"Mammy, you wouldn't make as much fuss if I was going
to be buried."
</p>

<p>
"'Fore de Lord, chile, dat would break Mammy's heart
cl'ar in two! You can't 'member how de joy went roun'
in all de cabins when young mas'r had a son born to be
de heir. Why de 'clar' o' peace wan't nuffin to it!"
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't think I could remember that!" said the
girl, with great dignity and a withering accent, "seeing
as I was not in the rejoicing. You are getting old and
doted, mammy!"
</p>

<p>
The old slave woman wiped her eyes. But to her comfort
she had found a delightful listener in little Annis,
who never wearied of the family legends, and who studied
the portraits in the great drawing room with a mysterious
sort of awe. There was a cavalier of the times of the
first Charles, with his slashed doublet, his Vandyke collar
and cuffs of what had been snowy linen and elegant lace,
and his picturesque hat with its long plume: a sharp-featured,
handsome face in spite of a certain languid indifference.
There was another in a suit of green camlet,
richly laced, and the great periwig of close-curled
rings. The hand, almost covered with costly lace ruffles,
rested lightly on the jeweled hilt of the rapier that hung
at his side. There were two plainer men: one suggestive
of Puritan times; one, round, rosy, quite modern in the
half-Continental costume, that one would easily guess was
the squire in his youth. Beside it was Mistress Mason
in her wedding gown of satin trimmed with a perfect
cloud of Venice point, a stomacher set with precious
stones, and a brocaded petticoat. Like a soft mist a veil
floated about her exquisite shoulders, fastened at the top
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_40' name='Page_40'>[40]</a></span>
with a diamond clasp. There was the beauty of the Verneys
and the Carringtons in her face.
</p>

<p>
"That is our own mother," said Varina as she was
showing Annis the ancestors of the house. "She is a
great deal handsomer than your mother, and yours has
no such fine gowns. This has been laid away, and we
shall all wear it as a wedding gown when our turn comes.
Aunt Catharine said once there was a fortune in the lace.
Has your mother nothing?"
</p>

<p>
"She has a string of pearls and some beautiful rings,
but I have never seen any gowns."
</p>

<p>
"And she is not handsome," declared the young miss
with a decisive air.
</p>

<p>
"She is beautiful to me, and sweet and kind, and loves
me," replied Annis with a swelling heart.
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;our mother loved us. It was very cruel in
God to take her away. I would a hundred times rather
have her than your mother."
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry she is gone. Everybody must love her
own mother the best."
</p>

<p>
The tone was sweet at the beginning and confident at
the end, yet it hardly suited the daughter of the house.
</p>

<p>
"You would not have been here, then," triumphantly.
</p>

<p>
"No. But we should have left the settlement and
come to Baltimore. I liked it there. And there was a
kindly old lady who begged mother to leave me with her,
but your father said 'Nay' quite sharply. And at first
she would not consent to the marriage."
</p>

<p>
There had been some jesting discussion at the Carringtons'.
Annis had not clearly understood it.
</p>

<p>
"But she would have had to. Father makes people do
his way. He is the master of everything."
</p>

<p>
Annis was silent. She did not yet clearly understand
the mystery, but she sometimes thought she would be
glad to go back to the settlement and have her mother all
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_41' name='Page_41'>[41]</a></span>
to herself. Something seemed to come between continually.
There were numerous cares for the housewife
on so large a plantation, with children and servants, visitors
and a rather exigent husband.
</p>

<p>
There were many beautiful articles and curiosities in
the great drawing room. But Annis liked Charles better
as a guide. They never jarred upon each other, and
he had no jealousy. Then, he really liked his new
mother.
</p>

<p>
Varina cared little for books. Besides the worn Froissart
there was a copy of Captain John Smith's adventures,
which were wonderful to both children, and here Annis
could supply many queries about the Indians, who were
rapidly disappearing from this vicinity. Gentle and quiet
as Charles was, he had a great desire for adventure, and
a soldier's life appeared very heroic to him. But the War
of the Revolution seemed ages ago to the younger people,
though the slaves often gathered about the brushwood
fires and related stirring scenes almost as if they had been
eyewitnesses.
</p>

<p>
Christmas was a great festival. At nearly every
plantation there was a gathering of neighbors and
friends, and in some houses visits of days, when
extra guests were invited to dinner and a dance given for
the young people. And though the exchange of gifts
had none of the costly features of the present day, there
was much real affection and generosity. Annis thought
it delightful. There was an influx of cousins, with some
little girls who were very merry and who found Annis
quite charming.
</p>

<p>
It had been planned for Jaqueline to return, but no reliable
acquaintance seemed ready to undertake the journey.
Truth to tell, Jaqueline was tasting the sweets of
incipient bellehood, and was quite a prize to the young
collegians. His parish duties not being very onerous, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_42' name='Page_42'>[42]</a></span>
Reverend Conway added to them a professorship in the
college, and the rectory was quite a center of society.
What with frequent guests and the care of two small
girls, Mrs. Conway found her hands quite full, and unable
to restrict her nieces' pleasures to her own ideas of
what was advisable. Then, she was glad to have the gay,
lively girl, who was ready to sing at anyone's bidding,
and had a gracious way with the elders as well as the
young. She had often longed for the children of this
first motherhood, though she accepted her new duties in a
satisfactory manner.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">A NEW PRESIDENT.</span>
</h2>

<p>
The inaugurations at New York and Philadelphia
had been marked with a certain degree of pomp and
stateliness. The first one in Washington had been simple
almost to indifference. There had preceded it a bitter
campaign, and the Federalists kept the peace with a silent
dignity that was chilling in the extreme. Mr. Adams
left Washington at once. And the city then was in a dismal
stage, with few improvements perfected. There was
really no accommodation for visitors, and many still believed
the Capital would be removed. They delighted to
call it "The Wilderness City," "Capital of Miserable
Huts," and "A mudhole almost equal to the great Serbonian
bog." Mrs. Abigail Adams had not been charmed
with the White House nor the city. The great marsh
stretched out in a most forbidding and discouraging manner.
Piles of rubbish and heaps of stone, with unsightly
masses of timber, gave the place anything but a homelike
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_43' name='Page_43'>[43]</a></span>
aspect. There was no accommodation for the wives of
congressmen if they had chosen to come. Gay New York
and charming Philadelphia disdained Washington.
</p>

<p>
Eight years had changed much of this. True, Georgetown
was more attractive and growing faster, but streets
were beginning to be cleared up, mudholes filled in, walks
laid, and handsome houses erected. The wife of the secretary
of state, charming Dolly Madison, had healed
many differences, and Mrs. Madison's drawing room
was a favorite resort for senators, ministers, and diplomats.
She was often asked to preside at the White
House. Mrs. Randolph, the President's daughter, on her
very first visit had been delighted with her, and the two
became lifelong friends.
</p>

<p>
Her bright and vivacious sister, Anna Payne, had added
no little zest to social life, and her marriage had been
quite an event in the slowly growing city. The Van Ness
mansion was also the scene of much gayety. Old Virginia
belles came up for a few weeks, and there were balls
and parties at Georgetown, and no end of tea drinkings.
The young women found plenty of cavaliers, and when
riding was possible gay parties sallied out, stopping at
some country inn for midday refreshments.
</p>

<p>
And though there were many grave questions pending,
this promised to be a day of unwonted satisfaction. For
the first time great preparations were made. Washington
and Georgetown people invited friends, as in those days
people were given to hospitality.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Jettson had kept her sister Marian a large part of
the winter, much to Dolly's discomfiture, but Mr. Floyd
had sent for Marian and refused them both the anticipated
pleasure of the inauguration.
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline had come home an undeniable young lady,
with her hair done high on her head and sundry touches
in her attire that made her very attractive and coquettish.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_44' name='Page_44'>[44]</a></span>
There was great rejoicing, from least to greatest, much
envying on Patricia's part, much delight on Varina's and
Charles', and a pretty, shy, winsome admiration from
Annis.
</p>

<p>
There was of course the duty visit to the Pineries.
Then Jaqueline came down to her Aunt Jane's.
</p>

<p>
"I'd planned such a delightful time!" declared Mrs.
Jettson, between satisfaction and vexation. "There is to
be a gay season, with balls and parties and dinners. And,
really, the young men are getting to be quite factors in
society. I wanted both the girls and you; and, Jaqueline,
you've grown monstrously pretty, and your manners have
improved so much that you might be fresh from London
or Paris. There have been so many fine people here the
last two or three years, and building is going on at a rapid
rate. Philadelphia and New York will not be able to look
down on us much longer. I meant to give you young
people a dance and supper, and father won't let the girls
come. Marian was mad as a hornet, and poor Dolly
stamped around. Father grows queerer about them. But
<i>I</i> wanted the company as well. I'm not an old woman, if
I have two babies. And I'm quite sure it will be a success
if you will come."
</p>

<p>
"Of course I shall be delighted. Why, it's just charming!"
and the pretty face was alight with smiles.
</p>

<p>
"I shall ask all the folks up for the grand event. You
see, brother Randolph is a true Madison man. And, do
you know, I like your new mother wonderfully. She is
quite like an elder sister, and you'll have a fine time.
You'll be just spoiled," laughingly. "But you're not to
call me Aunt Jane any more. I won't have it from a tall
girl like you, who will no doubt be married herself next
winter. How many disconsolates did you leave at Williamsburg?"
</p>

<p>
"None, I think, so deeply smitten but that a course of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_45' name='Page_45'>[45]</a></span>
Greek and Latin will restore them. I did have a splendid
time, though Aunt Catharine would persist in considering
me about twelve. It was positively funny. But I had
Louis to manage for me. Oh, Jane, I'm awfully sorry
about the girls! They cried with disappointment. And
they did not know about the party!"
</p>

<p>
"No, I hadn't the cruelty to speak of that. But I'll
whisper to you, Jaqueline, and you must not breathe it.
Somebody here has taken a tremendous fancy to Marian.
He is well connected, a young civil engineer, and a militia
lieutenant; but we are afraid father will blaze out and perhaps
refuse to listen. He has quite set his heart on
Marian marrying their next neighbor, that Mr. Greaves
who lost his wife last summer and has no one to look after
his four children but the slave mammy. And Marian
just hates him. The idea! Oh, Jaqueline, it is just comforting
to have someone to talk to, a young person that
you can say anything to!"
</p>

<p>
"Marian told me. Of course there is the fine estate
and the slaves. I do suppose old people think a great
deal of that," and there was a touch of regretful wisdom
that sat oddly upon the young girl. "And four children!
I wouldn't want 'em."
</p>

<p>
"A young girl has no business with another woman's
children. I want you to see this young man. And I want
to get your father interested. I think after a little I'll
bring it about."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Greaves doesn't seem very"&mdash;Jaqueline knit her
pretty brows, thinking of the fervent tones and impassioned
glances that had marked her victorious sway&mdash;"very
deeply smitten. He and grandfather talked politics
and war all the evening."
</p>

<p>
"But he means business. He has asked for her. He
thinks it only respectful to wait a year before beginning
his new addresses. So we have until July."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_46' name='Page_46'>[46]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't marry him," declared Jaqueline with much
vigor.
</p>

<p>
"I dare say your father will be easy enough about
lovers if they are of the right kind. Don't be in a hurry.
Have a good time first. You are so young."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Jettson had insisted upon taking in the whole
family, and they came the evening before, being comfortably
stowed away, although some of Mrs. Mason's relatives
who had lately come to Washington insisted upon
sharing the honors.
</p>

<p>
Annis and Charles had been much interested, and questioned
Mr. Evans in every conceivable manner as to what
it was for, and why America did not have a king or an
emperor. Patricia was bubbling over with delight.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately the day was fair, and everything seemed
auspicious. Salutes of cannon were fired from the navy
yard at dawn, and responded to from Fort Warburton.
The militia from Alexandria and Georgetown, in fine array,
marched into the city to escort the new President to
the Capitol. Thousands of people gathered along the
way, and there was a great hurrahing, emphasized by the
waving of hats and handkerchiefs. Mr. Mason and
his wife and the two younger children were in a
carriage, while the two girls went with Mr. and Mrs.
Jettson.
</p>

<p>
Annis looked out curiously at the scene. There was the
tall form of Mr. Jefferson, quite in contrast with the
smaller one of his friend, who bore himself with becoming
dignity. At twelve Mr. Madison reverently took the
oath of office and made his inaugural address, when the
cheers and enthusiasm became deafening. It was the first
really grand ceremony of the kind that Washington had
witnessed.
</p>

<p>
And now the new President reviewed the array of
soldiers, and eager interest marked every step. It was indeed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_47' name='Page_47'>[47]</a></span>
a gala day. Many people were driving around in
their carriages, enjoying the sunshine and the crowd.
</p>

<p>
Then the President, with most of the officers and senators,
returned to his home, where Mrs. Madison had prepared
tables of refreshments for all who chose to call and
pay their respects to the new magistrate.
</p>

<p>
A fine young fellow in Continental uniform paused at
the carriage of the Jettsons, and greeted them cordially.
</p>

<p>
"This is something like," he said. "Simplicity may
be very good in its way, when one cannot help himself,
but the nation ought to honor its ruler. I am proud to
be in it."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Jettson turned and introduced Mr. Ralston to the
girls, who smilingly acknowledged his presence.
</p>

<p>
"Then you could not persuade Miss Floyd?" and he
glanced up wistfully.
</p>

<p>
"Father is not quite in accord with the administration,
and he would not consent to her return."
</p>

<p>
"I am desperately sorry. I managed at the eleventh
hour, which was early this morning, to get a ticket to the
ball. Some dear friends of mine would have been delighted
to chaperone Miss Floyd, if she could have consented
to so short a notice. And there will be so many
festivities!"
</p>

<p>
"I regret it deeply," returned Mrs. Jettson. "What
a shame!" she said to her husband when Mr. Ralston had
left them. "At Long's there could be only a given number
accommodated. And to have missed such a fine array
of people! I should like to be there myself."
</p>

<p>
The ball was considered quite a sumptuous affair. A
host of beautiful women in their most elegant attire, military
men who had not laid aside their trappings "in the
piping times of peace," and the brilliant uniforms of the
different legations, made a picture quite worthy of the
young Capital. Mrs. Madison, in her robe of yellow velvet,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_48' name='Page_48'>[48]</a></span>
her Paris turban with its bird-of-paradise plume, her neck
and arms adorned with pearls, dispensed her smiles and
greetings with the wonderful tact and sweetness which
were never to desert her; jest and repartee ran round the
circle; and Mr. Jefferson shone in his genial cordiality.
Someone remarked upon his gayety, and the gravity of
the new incumbent.
</p>

<p>
"Can you wonder at it?" he asked. "My shoulders
have just been freed from a burden of cares; he is just
beginning to assume them." Yet he gave his friend a
glance of sympathy and tenderness that indicated a continuance
of the lifelong friendship.
</p>

<p>
Some glowing accounts of the ball found their way to
different papers, and it seemed as if Washington was suddenly
looming into conspicuousness.
</p>

<p>
The children were tired with the day's pleasures and
ready to go bed. But the next morning they were
eager to inspect the Capitol.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Adams' plaint about it still held good in many
respects. The wings alone had a finished aspect. There
were the Senate Chamber and House of Representatives,
the nuclei of many things to come. But to Charles and
Annis, who looked at it through the romantic eyes of
childhood, enlarged by their rather narrow reading, it was
grand.
</p>

<p>
The two elder girls were more interested in Jane's party.
There were some of the younger representatives, not
averse to dancing with pretty girls and having a merry
time while they were off duty. If Philadelphia and New
York rather disdained the social pleasures of the newer
city, it was a great favorite with the more southern States;
and Virginia did all honor to her fine line of Presidents.
</p>

<p>
For, after all, the provincialism was not so marked.
There were people who dared the voyage to Europe with
as much complacency as the steam traveler of to-day, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_49' name='Page_49'>[49]</a></span>
who studied the best Europe had to offer. Young men
were sent abroad for education; not a few young women
had a year or two of finishing abroad. There were noted
foreigners, too, who left an impress on society: Albert
Gallatin and his charming wife, the learned Swiss scholar
and the American girl who had grafted some delightful
foreign ways on a very thorough foundation of patriotic
culture. Mrs. Monroe was a famous New York beauty
who had lost her heart to Virginia, and the Vice President
was from the northern State that was slowly accepting
the new city. There were foreign ministers and their
wives who accepted the republican methods and the dignified
simplicity, if it did lack the stately elements of the
courts abroad.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Arthur Jettson was one of the enthusiasts, and already
saw great possibilities for the infant city. On the
staff of engineers and largely interested in building, he
laid the plans of the future before new acquaintances and
had the good fortune to interest many. Old David Burns
had already made a great fortune in shrewd land speculations.
And although the Presidential mansion was toward
the eastward, there were many who argued that the
trend would be more westward. There was Georgetown,
a really thriving place, whose gravity did not depend on
Congress in session.
</p>

<p>
He had already persuaded Mr. Mason to make some investments,
though the elder man shook his head rather
ruefully at the unpromising aspect as they drove around.
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline and Patricia were much more interested in
the invitations to the party. But the day after the inauguration
Lieutenant Ralston came in, though now in
citizen's attire, with an eager manner and sparkling
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if you could be induced to take the young
ladies to a reception to-morrow evening?" he inquired.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_50' name='Page_50'>[50]</a></span>
"It will be rather informal and a crush, to be sure, but
they will be able to see both Presidents, though not the
White House. That will come later on. Next week the
Madisons will no doubt be domiciled there. If you would
prefer waiting&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no!" replied Mrs. Jettson. "The crowd will be
well worth seeing. I do not despise crowds," laughingly.
"Did you go to the ball?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, with some brother officers, and wishing all the
while your sister could have been there. It was an elegant
scene, I assure you. I am proud of the beauty of my
countrywomen. Mrs. Madison has been accustomed to
honors, to be sure, but this was in a new rôle, as chief lady
in her own right. And she graced the occasion. She is
charming. We shall have a brilliant administration in
spite of the perplexities. Well&mdash;you will go, then?"
</p>

<p>
"We cannot afford to miss it. Mr. Mason talks of returning
in a day or two."
</p>

<p>
"I have hardly seen the young ladies. Can you not
lay an embargo on them?"
</p>

<p>
"I shall try, for my own sake," she returned laughingly.
"Thanks for your trouble."
</p>

<p>
"It is a pleasure to me."
</p>

<p>
The party had gone out for views of Washington and
an inspection of the Capitol. When they returned Jaqueline
ran up to Jane's room, her face beaming with interest,
since she had been introduced to several representatives.
Mrs. Jettson looked up from a pile of finery.
</p>

<p>
"You suggest a hollyhock in brilliant array," said
Jaqueline mirthfully. "Are you going to hold an auction?"
</p>

<p>
Jane gave a half-amused sigh. "You have had an invitation
out, and there is very little time to prepare. I am
trying to think what can be altered. There is my pink
paduasoy with the race ruffles. I cannot get into the waist
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_51' name='Page_51'>[51]</a></span>
any more, but you are so slim. Just try it on. Anything
will do for a child like Patty."
</p>

<p>
"But where to in such fine feather?"
</p>

<p>
"To the Madisons'. Not a regular levee&mdash;something
much more informal. Lieutenant Ralston has it in hand.
I have my new brocade and the embroidered petticoat.
We can take this gown over to Mrs. Walker's, and coax
her to make it more youthful. I haven't worn it since
Floyd was a baby."
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline hurried off her woolen frock and slipped into
the pretty silken garment. The skirt answered, but the
bodice needed considerable alteration.
</p>

<p>
"And I thought I was slim; Jack, you have an elegant
figure. Now we must go at once to Mrs. Walker's, or it
may be too late. It's just down Pennsylvania Avenue.
Scipio will take it for us, and we will go over and do the
marketing. You will like the pink, won't you? It's very
becoming."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, how good you are! Yes, I just adore it. Do you
really mean me to have it? How can I thank you?"
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline patted and caressed it with her soft fingers.
</p>

<p>
"I did mean it for Dolly, but father is so queer about
things&mdash;and gowns. He and mother keep in the same
little round, with the same friends, and think that it is
all-sufficient for the girls. And I'm so afraid Marian will
give in to the constant dropping that is said to wear away
the stone. Jacky dear," in an almost plaintive tone,
"won't you be&mdash;that is&mdash;I mean&mdash;I can't think just how
to put it&mdash;only you won't try to win away Lieutenant Ralston,
will you, dear? I've set my heart on his making a
match with Marian. <i>You're</i> so pretty and coquettish!"
</p>

<p>
The color came and went in Mrs. Jettson's face, and her
voice dropped to a pleading cadence.
</p>

<p>
"Why, no! But what has he to do with&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he brought the invitation! He knows just how
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_52' name='Page_52'>[52]</a></span>
to bring about everything. And the Ralstons are delightful
people&mdash;well-to-do and all that. Marian would be so
happy! It is a shame she isn't here. But we must not
dawdle. Get into your coat and hat again."
</p>

<p>
Scipio, the butler and upper servant, came with his
best bow and put the parcel carefully into the big basket,
covering the delicate stuff with a napkin. Then he trotted
along behind the two ladies, looking as if weighty matters
devolved upon him.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Walker kept three rooms upstairs. In the front
one she displayed her goods: silks, velvets and laces, flowers
and feathers. She had laid in a new and extensive
stock. Two or three women were chaffering. But Mrs.
Walker left them presently, and when she heard the errand
summoned them into the adjoining room. Jaqueline
hated to leave the beautiful show on which her eyes had
feasted.
</p>

<p>
And though women were fond enough of gay attire
shipped from London and Paris, and Belgium frippery
and laces when they could get them, they were beginning
to think it was not always necessary to send to Philadelphia
or to New York. And to her stock of materials Mrs.
Walker had added a workroom, not so much for the making
of garments as the altering and refurbishing of party
gowns, caps, and turbans.
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline was put in the pink gown again, and when
Mrs. Walker looked her over she decided upon the sort of
bodice there must be for a young girl, and promised to
have it done the next afternoon. Scipio would come
for it.
</p>

<p>
Center Market was the only place of account to household
purveyors. They went thither followed by the slave,
meeting other ladies with an obsequious attendant.
Marketing was one of the duties of a good housewife.
Some had come in their carriages. There was an exchange
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_53' name='Page_53'>[53]</a></span>
of friendliness, as is often the case in the infancy
of towns, and some bits of family gossip, some references
to the ball at Long's Hotel.
</p>

<p>
All the others had come in when they returned. Charles
had his brain full of marvels. Varina was tired and cross.
</p>

<p>
"I shall have to send you back home," declared her
father. "Indeed, perhaps we had all better go to-morrow.
We are to take supper to-night with the Carringtons,
over at Georgetown. Jaqueline and Patty, you must go
with us&mdash;that was Madam Carrington's orders. She has
not seen you in a long while."
</p>

<p>
Annis crept around to her mother and took her hand,
looking up wistfully. It seemed as if everyone wanted
her mother.
</p>

<p>
"No, you can't go to-morrow," said Mrs. Jettson.
"At least, the girls cannot. They have a state invitation,
and I have been to get a proper gown for Jaqueline," and
she laughed mischievously.
</p>

<p>
"Jane!" said the squire sharply; "what nonsense!
Jaqueline has gowns and frocks and fal-lals enough. You
will make her vainer than a peacock. What is this invitation,
pray?"
</p>

<p>
"To pay our respects to Mr. and Mrs. Madison. Dear
me, Randolph, think how father would rail at such republican
crowds as have haunted the place to see plain Mr.
President! They are to move to the White House early
next week, when Mr. Jefferson goes to Monticello; and
then, no doubt, there will be more state. But the Madisons
have always kept such an open, hospitable house, and
welcomed guests so charmingly."
</p>

<p>
"Jane, you are getting to be an astute politician. No
doubt Arthur has his eye on some street or creek or
stream for improvement, and is engineering a grant
through the House. Not but what Washington needs it
badly enough. There's muddy old Tiber, and lanes full of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_54' name='Page_54'>[54]</a></span>
pitfalls, and last year's weeds like battalions of an army.
Well, I must not grumble, for I have a finger in the pie.
Virginia Avenue, for all its high-sounding name, is a disgrace
to the State standing sponsor for it; and I am quite
sure my money is buried in bogs. So you and Arthur
try your best with the new administration. I'm too old a
dog to be apt at new tricks."
</p>

<p>
"But it isn't Arthur's doings. Lieutenant Ralston is
to convoy us thither," returned Jane.
</p>

<p>
"Well, go and get ready, girls. We will start soon
after dinner and return early. Lucky the fandango
wasn't to-night, or the brave lieutenant would have to
content himself with Jane."
</p>

<p>
Annis kept close to her mother. After dinner she followed
her to her dressing room.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose, mamma, I couldn't go with you?" she
asked wistfully, as her mother was making great puffs
out of her abundant hair.
</p>

<p>
"My dear&mdash;there will be all grown people, and nothing
to interest a little girl," was the soft reply.
</p>

<p>
"But I don't mind interest. I could sit very still and
watch the rest of you. I&mdash;" The child's voice faltered.
</p>

<p>
Her mother bent over and kissed her, endangering the
structure of hair she was piling up.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my dear, to-morrow perhaps we will go home
and you will have me altogether. It will be only a little
while. You see, people do not ask little girls out to tea."
</p>

<p>
"But you always took me before. Oh, mamma, I can't
like all these people, there are too many of them! I do
not want anyone but you."
</p>

<p>
The child clung convulsively to her mother. Patricia
Mason's heart was torn between the two loves. For each
day she was learning to love her generous, large-hearted
husband with a deeper affection, and taking a warmer interest
in the children. The hurt and jealous feeling of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_55' name='Page_55'>[55]</a></span>
Annis was very natural; she could hardly blame her little
daughter. Indeed, it would have pained her sorely
if the child had been easily won away. Yet scenes like
this smote the very depths of her soul. As Annis grew
older she would understand that nothing could change a
mother's love, though circumstances might appear to divide
it.
</p>

<p>
Patricia kissed her tenderly, unclasped her arms, and
went on with her preparations. The slow tears coursed
each other down the soft cheek in the grave quiet harder
to bear than sobs.
</p>

<p>
"Patty! Patty!" called the good-humored voice up the
stairs, "don't prink all the afternoon, or you will outshine
your old husband and put him out of temper. Girls,
come! The horses are tired of waiting."
</p>

<p>
A quick footfall sounded on the stair, and Jaqueline's
voice was heard laughing gayly. Then Patty the younger,
peered into the room.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I thought I was the last! Can I do anything
for you? Here is your cloak. We are not in summer yet.
It really is warmer at home; but I'm glad to be here, all
the same. Why, madam mother, you look so pretty and
young father will have to introduce us as sisters&mdash;the
Three Graces. Here are your gloves. Good-by, little
Annis. Charles will look after you."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Mason kissed her little girl. "Will you not come
downstairs?" she whispered.
</p>

<p>
Annis shook her head.
</p>

<p>
She heard the merry voices, and presently the sound of
the wheels. Then she leaned her head down on a chair,
and felt more solitary than in the Kentucky forests.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_56' name='Page_56'>[56]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">ROGER CARRINGTON.</span>
</h2>

<p>
"Wasn't it queer that Lieutenant Ralston should happen
in!" exclaimed Jaqueline at the breakfast
table. "We were just going in to supper, and Madam
Carrington would have him join us. She is a charming
old lady, and Mrs. Carrington, the daughter-in-law, is
bright and entertaining. They're some way back connections
of our own mother's, of both mothers," with a bright
blush, nodding over at Patricia. "And there are two
sons, fine young men&mdash;one is private secretary to Colonel
Monroe. We shall see him to-night. Only what do you
think? He advises us to wait until Mrs. Madison is in
the White House. And Mr. Ralston said, See her in her
own house."
</p>

<p>
"Jack," said her father, using the detested cognomen,
"your tongue is hung in the middle and swings both
ways. Jane, Mrs. Carrington sent her regards to you,
and would like very much to meet you, since both of her
grandsons are acquainted with Arthur. The relationship
seems to puzzle most people, and they take you for my
daughter. Do I really look old enough for a grandfather?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Jettson laughed at that. It was rather confusing
at times.
</p>

<p>
"And they begged us to come over and make a visit.
Both ladies are so fond of girls. Madam Carrington said
they tried to keep someone with them all the time. And,
Annis, they were so much interested in hearing about you,
and wished you had been brought along."
</p>

<p>
Annis raised her eyes to her mother with a soft reproach
in them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_57' name='Page_57'>[57]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"But I am the oldest," said Varina with jealous
dignity.
</p>

<p>
"When next I go out to supper I shall have to take a
caravan," declared Mr. Mason humorously. "Jane, <i>do</i>
you think you can manage these girls for a few days and
keep them out of the clutches of the young men? You
will have your hands full. But I am needed at home, and
I feel that we must go. So after breakfast we will gather
up the small fry. Charles, have you seen enough of Washington?"
</p>

<p>
"Not half enough, but I'll come back some time. And
I think I'll be a senator."
</p>

<p>
"What&mdash;not President!"
</p>

<p>
"I should have to be Vice President first," he returned
gravely, at which they all laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I do not see why you should hurry!" exclaimed Jane.
"The house is large enough for you all."
</p>

<p>
"There's a storm brewing, for one thing, and it's a
busy season. Then we do not desire to drive you into
insanity."
</p>

<p>
"My brains are on a more solid foundation than that
would imply," retorted Jane.
</p>

<p>
There was quite a confusion when they rose. The
squire was always in a hurry when any arrangement was
settled upon. And since Jane was like an elder sister to
the girls&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You will have to keep them over to next week," he
began. "I shall not be able to get away before&mdash;well, the
very last. You might let them spend a day or two with
the Carringtons."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we shall get along all right, never fear!"
</p>

<p>
"They're only children, you know," and the squire knit
his brow over a phase of fatherhood he could not make
plain to himself, much less explain to another. "I had an
idea Catharine would sober Jaqueline down a little, being
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_58' name='Page_58'>[58]</a></span>
a clergyman's wife and all that, but she's just as much of
a child as ever."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you need not feel worried about Jaqueline. And
it will be very nice for them both to see the President
and Mr. Jefferson, who is sure to be there. Everybody
is rushing to do them honor. I wish you could
stay."
</p>

<p>
"I've seen them both many a time, Jane, and every
other President. Your father is right in one thing, Washington
<i>was</i> a grand man. There&mdash;do not let the girls run
wild."
</p>

<p>
Annis scarcely let her mother out of her sight. Mrs.
Jettson kissed her and said she was a nice little thing
and must come again. Charles was enthusiastic over his
good time, and had much to talk about on the homeward
journey.
</p>

<p>
"You have used your eyes to some purpose," said his
mother with smiling commendation.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Evans thought so, as well. He was very proud of
his pupil.
</p>

<p>
Annis enjoyed the great world out of doors more than
she did her lessons. When they were over she and
Charles rambled about the beautiful country-sides, gathering
armfuls of flowers, listening to the singing birds that
filled the woods. The whole plantation was astir with
life. Corn and tobacco, wheat and oats, were the great
staples, but there was much besides in fruit and vegetables,
in flocks and herds. Slaves were busy from morning to
night; it seemed as if the place was dotted with them.
Randolph Mason was an easy master. Mrs. Mason
found the care of so large a household no light thing. It
was truly a colony of people depending upon them for advice
and training of all sorts, for comfort in sorrow or
death, for a willing ear in all troubles.
</p>

<p>
It was a full fortnight before Mr. Mason could find time
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_59' name='Page_59'>[59]</a></span>
to go for his girls. Jaqueline had sipped pleasure continually.
The reception had indeed been a crush and an
informal affair, a mere calling upon the head of the nation
in a congratulatory way. Yet there were beautifully
gowned women, and famous men, and Mrs. Madison was
cordial and affable. In the dining room the table was
replenished continually, and the smiling waiters seemed
at everyone's elbow.
</p>

<p>
After that Mr. Jefferson had gone to his beloved Monticello,
although there was no wife to welcome him, and
only one daughter now. And the new President was established
at the White House. First there was a state
dinner to the ministers and the official family, and then
a levee.
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline and Patricia were surprised by a call from
Mrs. Carrington, who had driven over with her son to give
her invitation in person and take them back with her to
Georgetown.
</p>

<p>
A quaint old house full of nooks and corners, and a
garden laid out with curious winding walks, full of old-fashioned
flowers and shrubs, some having been brought
from the royal gardens of Paris, and one queer space with
clipped yews and a great tulip bed, so sheltered from the
wind and with such a sunny exposure that it was showing
color in the buds already.
</p>

<p>
Patricia, with her girlish eagerness, went to the heart
of Madam at once. She was so frank and chatty, and
laughed with such an inspiriting sound, that it gave the
quiet house ripples of gayety.
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline and Mrs. Carrington fraternized in a delightful
manner. She was a rather small, fair woman,
whose education abroad and whose family had been her
chief virtues in the eyes of her mother-in-law, who was a
great stickler for birth. She had made a good wife and
mother, though it must be confessed that when Madam
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_60' name='Page_60'>[60]</a></span>
Carrington lost her son she took complete possession of
her grandsons. In spite of strong patriotism Roger had
been sent to Oxford for three years, and had taken his degree
at law in Baltimore. Ralph was quite a bookworm,
but extremely fond of agriculture.
</p>

<p>
The longing of both women had been for a daughter.
Though they seldom compared notes on the subject,
Roger's wife was a matter of much speculation to them.
Early marriages were the rule rather than the exception;
and though they were ready to invite relatives and friends
for visits and select admirable girls, Roger was single
at twenty-four, an admirer of the sex and quite
fond of pleasure, and ever ready to make himself
agreeable.
</p>

<p>
Squire Mason had insisted that his girls were but children,
but Jaqueline was assuming the graces of womanhood
rapidly. Mrs. Carrington admired her slim, lithe
figure, her pretty face with its fine complexion and laughing
eyes that often twinkled from an overflow of mirth.
There was in the young people of that day a very charming
deference to elders, and with all Jaqueline's wildness
and love of fun there was the innate touch of good breeding,
the debt it was considered one positively owed to society.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ralph had gathered quite a menagerie of small pet
animals; and, as no one was allowed to disturb the birds,
the garden and strip of woods still remaining were filled
with their melody. There was a summerhouse that,
while it looked light and was overrun with blossoming
vines, was secure from rain and had one furnished
room which was a great favorite with the young
man.
</p>

<p>
The little eminence gave a fine view of Rock Creek
and the wilder country to the northward. When improvements
begin, as is often the case, an estate not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_61' name='Page_61'>[61]</a></span>
large enough for a farm becomes unprofitable. The town
was growing rapidly; indeed, it had been a refuge when
the first Congress met in Washington, as there were so
few houses in the Capital. The patrician resort, where
men of note had mingled and discussed the interests of
the country over their choice Madeira and before the
blazing fire of their host, was Suter's tavern, which kept
its old reputation, being one of the historic places while
history was yet so new. And the Convent of the Visitation
was still a favorite with those who did not want to
send their daughters away from home, or were of the
same faith. Maryland had been settled largely by Roman
Catholics, and Virginia was the first State to insist
on equal rights for all denominations, while her people
were generally stanch Churchmen.
</p>

<p>
There was a cordial, attractive, and refined element in
Georgetown, and much gayety among the young people.
It was quite a common thing for foreigners to sneer at
the lack of courtly usage in the Colonies, and the want of
fine distinctions one found in foreign life, which were
the outgrowth of years of training and experience, and
where common people were held in awe by the "divinity
that doth hedge a king." But the men who had fought
side by side, slept on the ground, endured all kinds of
hardships for the sake of a free country, were imbued
with that sense of equality quite different from the mushroom
adjustment of the French Revolution. There was
a more generous culture of the soul, and much more intelligence
than the period is credited with. When one
looks back at the long line of statesmen, all more or less
identified with the great struggle and the pioneer mode
of life, one finds a galaxy of noble men that few lands can
equal, and who built an enduring name for themselves in
building their country.
</p>

<p>
Many of the young people had been educated abroad,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_62' name='Page_62'>[62]</a></span>
but Harvard, King's College, Nassau Hall, and William
and Mary were even now taking a high stand in educational
matters. And both Boston and Philadelphia had
some finishing schools, while the Moravian Seminary was
already quite celebrated for the repose and refinement of
manner young girls acquired within its nun-like seclusion.
But the ideal training of women had not gone far
beyond what was considered the strictly feminine boundary:
to be graceful and attractive, with a certain freshness
of repartee, to dance well, to entertain, and to order
a household. For in the higher circles one might have
to receive a count or a traveling lord or a French marquis,
or be sent abroad as the wife of some minister.
</p>

<p>
Georgetown had the advantage of more stability than
Washington, and had grown up around home centers.
Representatives came and went, often not considering it
worth while to bring their families. Senators were still
largely interested in the welfare of their own States,
rather than that of the distant Capital. Thus it came to
pass that Georgetown was really attractive and rapidly
improving. Streets had a more finished look. Gardens
were large and well kept, as there was no need of
crowding.
</p>

<p>
The Carrington young men had seen the progress of
advancement and yielded to it with a sense of foresight.
The outlying land had been cut up into squares&mdash;some
places sold, some rented. Roger had many excellent business
traits. Enough was left for beauty and a boundary
of fine forest trees on two sides, a third a prettily diversified
space sloping down to the creek, the other commanding
a fine view of the town.
</p>

<p>
"You ride, of course?" Roger had said the next morning
after their arrival.
</p>

<p>
"What Virginia girl does not?" Jaqueline returned
with a gay smile.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_63' name='Page_63'>[63]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"It bids fair to be a pleasant, sunny day, mother.

<p>
"Well, don't sing it to-day, and I will come home early
if I can get away, and take Miss Jaqueline out. Ralph,
you might invite Patricia. We will go up the creek road.
The birds are out in force already; the shore larks and the
thrush are making melody that would rejoice the heart of
Robin Hood."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;I have no habit," replied Jaqueline, her bright
face shadowed with disappointment.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, mother can look you up something. We have
attire that came over with my Lord de la Ware's ships.
Why shouldn't we be as proud as of old <i>Mayflower</i> tables
and cups and cloaks that the New Englanders dote on?"
</p>

<p>
"I can find something, I am sure," was the motherly
reply.
</p>

<p>
"Come out and take a breath of this delicious air."
</p>

<p>
That was meant for Jaqueline, who followed the young
man out on the porch, down the steps, and then they loitered
through the garden walk. The old white-haired
gardener was clearing up the garden beds.
</p>

<p>
"Mornin', massa and young missy," he said, with a
touch of his hand to his head, that looked like a wig of
crinkly wool.
</p>

<p>
Roger paused and gave some orders. Then he
gathered a few wild violets and gave them to the girl with
a graceful gesture.
</p>

<p>
His mother was watching. "If he only would come
to care for someone!" she mused. He was a general admirer
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_64' name='Page_64'>[64]</a></span>
of the sex, as the young men of that day were wont
to be. "And the Masons are a fine family. I would like
nothing better."
</p>

<p>
How many times she had given anticipatory consent!
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline sent him off with a pretty smile that he forgot
all about when Ajax whinnied and thrust his nose into
his master's hand. He had been waiting the last fifteen
minutes for the well-known voice.
</p>

<p>
"Fine old fellow!" his master said, with a caressing
touch of the hand. "And now we must be off, or the
colonel will be in a fume."
</p>

<p>
"I'll go up in the storeroom," began Mrs. Carrington,
glancing the young girl over. "Mother, I do believe
that green velvet jacket would fit Miss Jaqueline. You
wouldn't believe that I was once quite as slim as you?"
to the young girl.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure you're not to be called stout now," said the
madam, who despised a superabundance of flesh and yet
hated leanness. She was a fine, perfectly proportioned
woman, straight as an arrow, in spite of her more than
seventy years.
</p>

<p>
"But it always was tight in the shoulders. You see,
my dear, when things are ordered abroad there's not an
inch to alter them with&mdash;and then I went in mourning.
Would you like to come upstairs with me?"
</p>

<p>
Patricia had gone off to look at the guineas and peacocks
who had stoutly insisted upon early broods.
Madam had gone over to the open window with some fine
needlework. Jaqueline followed her hostess up the broad
stairway, through the spacious hall lighted by the cupola
above, and into an ell where the main storeroom was
snugly hidden.
</p>

<p>
What big old chests, with brass and iron clamps and
binding and hinges! A row of deep drawers that held
the best family linen and napery, some of it saved from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_65' name='Page_65'>[65]</a></span>
destruction thirty years ago in the war that was already
half forgotten. There was a sweet scent about the room,
made by bunches of lavender, rosemary, and a sweet clover,
much cultivated in gardens, and the fragrance of
dried rose leaves.
</p>

<p>
"There have been so many things laid by. We hoped
there would be girls to take them," and Mrs. Carrington
gave a soft sigh. "What a merry household you must
be! There are younger girls&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Varina, our own sister, and Annis, mother's little
girl."
</p>

<p>
"I am much interested in your new mother. She seems
a very kindly, amiable person. Back some distance she
was connected with the Carringtons, you know."
</p>

<p>
"And she was our own mother's cousin. Oh, we are
all in love with her, I assure you. And it is quite delightful
for father to have someone to consider him first of
all. It's funny what marriage does to a woman," and
Jaqueline gave a light laugh. "I suppose we <i>did</i> try
Aunt Catharine, but she used to nag at father until sometimes
he would lose his temper. And now she is always
quoting and admiring Mr. Conway, and runs around after
him as if he was a child. I am sure father is much more
delightful to live with, he is so merry and full of fun.
Not but what Mr. Conway is a gentleman and kind of
heart."
</p>

<p>
"But your aunt was no longer a young girl."
</p>

<p>
"And falling in love is a queer happening. Love is
writ blind," and Jaqueline laughed daintily.
</p>

<p>
"The little girl of your mother's?&mdash;I was sorry not to
see her. Is she like her mother?"
</p>

<p>
"She is a shy, dainty little thing, with a sweet temper
and a kind of homesick way now and then, as if she
longed to fly away somewhere with her mother. Of
course we all like her, and father has taken her to his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_66' name='Page_66'>[66]</a></span>
heart. Charles thinks her a nonesuch, since she is never
weary of hearing him read aloud. And though Charles
is the youngest, Varina has always been the baby, and I
think she is jealous. It is very amusing at times."
</p>

<p>
"I am glad you get along so well together. It must
be a great pleasure to your father to have a companion
of his very own. And you girls will presently marry."
</p>

<p>
"I mean to have a good, merry time first. What a pity
the winter is gone just as we have a new President!
Congress will soon be adjourned, and Jane says Washington
is dismal in the summer."
</p>

<p>
She opened a box, where the garment had lain many a
year, being taken out at the annual cleaning, brushed
carefully, and laid away again. It had a high collar and
lapels worked with veritable gold thread that had not
tarnished.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;many people do go away. The town has not
improved as we all hoped it would. But there is an old
adage that Rome was not built in a day. And we are a
comparatively new country. Oh, here is the jacket!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, how lovely!" cried Jaqueline.
</p>

<p>
"The buttons want rubbing up. We will take it to
Betty, who can tell if it needs altering. I keep the sleeves
stuffed out with cotton so it will not wrinkle or mat. A
London tailor made it, yet it looks fresh as if it had just
been sent over."
</p>

<p>
They found Betty, who was supervising some of the
sewing girls. Most of the ordinary wearing clothes of
the family and the servants' belongings were made in the
house. There was fine mending and darning, and much
drawn work done by some of the better-class house
slaves.
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline tried on the pretty jacket, and there was not
much alteration to be made in it. The young girl felt curiously
gratified as she studied her slim figure in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_67' name='Page_67'>[67]</a></span>
mirror. She had never owned anything so fine, and certainly
it was most becoming.
</p>

<p>
"Then, Betty, alter the band of my black cloth skirt.
That is the best we can do just now."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you are most kind!" and Jaqueline took both
hands in a warm clasp, while the glancing eyes were suffused
with delight.
</p>

<p>
"And now if you both like we will go out for an
airing, as I have some errands to do."
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline was ready for any diversion. Ralph proposed
to drive them, as he had a little business to attend
to.
</p>

<p>
There were several attractive shops in Georgetown, and
the hairdressing seemed to be brisk, judging from numerous
signs. In one window were wigs of various
colors from fair to dark. Indeed, there had been a great
era of wigs for both men and women, and especially
among the fair sex, who thought even two wigs much
cheaper than the continual bills of the hairdresser, when
they were crisped into curls, pinned up in puffs, and a
great crown laid on top of the head, built up in the artifices
known to fashion, to be surmounted by feathers.
The wide hoop was diminishing as well, and graceful figures
were likely to be once more the style.
</p>

<p>
The dinner-hour in most society families was at two,
and at the Carringtons' it was quite a stately meal, with
often an unexpected guest, made just as welcome as if
by invitation. And to-day a Mr. and Mrs. Hudson had
driven up from Alexandria&mdash;old friends who had many
things to inquire about after a winter of seclusion, and
most eager to learn how the new President had been received,
and whether there would really be war.
</p>

<p>
No one was in a hurry. People truly lived then. Patricia
thought it rather stupid, as no one referred to her
with any question or comment; even Mr. Ralph, who had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_68' name='Page_68'>[68]</a></span>
proved so entertaining all the morning, scarcely noticed
her, as he had to play the host. But Jaqueline quite shone.
When Mrs. Hudson heard she had been at the reception,
she must describe not only the ladies and their gowns,
but whether Mr. Jefferson was as ready to lay down the
cares of state as most people said, and if Mrs. Madison
had not aged by the continual demands that had been
made upon her.
</p>

<p>
"For she is coming quite to middle life," said Mrs.
Hudson.
</p>

<p>
"And could discount fully ten years," returned Ralph.
</p>

<p>
"They all paint and powder, I have heard. So much
dissipation cannot be good for women. But, then, she
has no children to look after. Her son is at school. It
does make a difference if one brings up half a dozen
children and has to think of getting them settled in
life."
</p>

<p>
She had had her share, good Mistress Hudson. Three
daughters to marry, which she had done well; one son to
bury; one rambling off, whether dead or alive no one
knew; and one still left, a prop for declining years, but his
mother was as anxious to keep him single as Mrs. Carrington
was that her sons should marry.
</p>

<p>
They had risen from the table, and the horses had been
ordered when Mr. Carrington came in. He saw how
Jaqueline's face lighted up.
</p>

<p>
"The days are a little longer, and we will have our
ride yet," he said in a whispered aside. But there was
still some talking to do. Jaqueline made her adieus and
went to put on her habit. Standing in the hall above, she
waited until patience was a lost virtue.
</p>

<p>
Then Roger Carrington called to her.
</p>

<p>
"I thought they would never go, they prosed and
prosed so!"
</p>

<p>
"We shall be old ourselves some day," he returned
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_69' name='Page_69'>[69]</a></span>
with a smile, "and perhaps prose while young people are
waiting."
</p>

<p>
Then he turned her around with gentlemanly grace,
admiration in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Is it the jackdaw that appears in borrowed plumes&mdash;some
bird I have heard tell of. Why birds should borrow
plumes&mdash;I am shamefully ignorant, am I not?" raising
her eyes with a spice of mischief.
</p>

<p>
"Let us go and ask Ralph," he said with assumed
gravity. "It will not take him long to run through two
or three tomes."
</p>

<p>
"And ride by moonlight?"
</p>

<p>
"There is no moon."
</p>

<p>
"Does she not look well, Roger? A tailor could not
have fitted the habit better. Do not go very far, for the
air might grow chilly again."
</p>

<p>
"We will go up the creek a short distance."
</p>

<p>
Then he mounted her upon the pretty mare, his
brother's favorite, for Ralph had not cared to ride. Patricia
looked on a little disappointed, yet she did not really
wish to go, for Madam Carrington had been telling her a
curious love story about a little maid who had been sent
over with a number of redemptioners, as those who were
bound for a number of years were called. She had attracted
the pity of a kindly man, who had purchased her
years of service for his wife. Then the son had fallen in
love with her, which had roused the mother's anger, when
she sent her son to England to be educated and perhaps
fall in love with a cousin. The little maid was rather
hardly treated, when someone came to the colony in
search of her, and it turned out that she was well born
and heiress to a grand estate, held by a relative who
had formed a villainous plot against her and reported her
dead. Now that he was dying without heirs, he was desirous
of making tardy reparation.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_70' name='Page_70'>[70]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
There were few story books to fall into girls' hands in
those days. Swift and Sterne and Smollett were kept out
of reach. Miss Burney was hardly considered proper,
and Miss Austen had not been heard of in the Colonies.
</p>

<p>
Patricia was fond of old legends and ghost stories, with
which the plantation was rife, and which had grown up
about old houses. Unhappy lovers had a weird, fascinating
interest for young girls, even if the lives of the day
were the reverse of sentimental. All through the dinner
she had been wondering if the little maid met her lover
again; but that she came back to America, she knew, for
her portrait hung in the hall among the Carrington ladies.
</p>

<p>
Ajax and Daphne rubbed noses, flung up their heads,
and started off. Tame enough now is the winding creek,
which was rough and rapid then, and which traveled from
the upper edge of Maryland, gathering in many a little
stream, rushing along in some places over great stones,
winding about placidly in others, and then joining the
Potomac.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">A TOUCH OF NATURE.</span>
</h2>

<p>
There had been a breath of spring in the air for a
day or two, and all nature welcomed the softness,
with the numerous sounds of awakening life. Wild bees
were out foraging. The catkins of the alders had swelled
to bursting, the maples were showing red, tufts of grass
were assuming the peculiar hazy, suggestive green through
the furzy deadness of winter, while here and there a
field of grain displayed the brilliance of a velvet carpet.
The trees had that dreamy purplish tint of springtime, and
waved their leafless branches with wooing softness.
</p>

<p>
The road ran alongside of the brook and was in fair
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_71' name='Page_71'>[71]</a></span>
order for the time of the year. Now and then some bird
flung out a note of rejoicing. They went by degrees down
a valley until they struck a wild gorge with overhanging
rocks, where a multitude of crows were holding council,
and suddenly wheeled off, making a dark shadow over the
path.
</p>

<p>
"A month later it will be beautiful," Roger Carrington
said. "But I suppose you have a surfeit over the Potomac?"
nodding his head to the southward. "Or perhaps
you would have liked it better about Georgetown.
I fancied my mother had shown you everything worth
seeing. Few people know how fine the road is up this
way."
</p>

<p>
He looked a little doubtfully at his companion. Perhaps
she was too young to appreciate it.
</p>

<p>
"I have never been this way before. We were out on
the Potomac last summer when we were visiting my sister,
the first time we came to Washington. Regulation
philosophy considers home the best place for children,"
and she smiled archly.
</p>

<p>
"I like large families. You can't think how your father
interested us in the description of you all. How many are
there?"
</p>

<p>
"Five of us and the sister of adoption."
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Mason quite charmed us. She has had a rather
eventful life. There is a brother&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"We begin and end with boys. Charles would delight
your brother Ralph. Louis is in college. He has some
aspirations for the law or political life, but his present desire
runs the way of pleasure and fun. The college boys
are quite adepts at mischief."
</p>

<p>
"You were down there?"
</p>

<p>
"My aunt married and went to Williamsburg, you
know. And Uncle Conway is connected with the college.
Yes, I had a good, gay time. And I like&mdash;fun."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_72' name='Page_72'>[72]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
She looked it, with the sparkle in her eye and the changing
color on her cheek. She was very pretty, but an eager
child.
</p>

<p>
"And if we had some girls to make merry! Real girls,
I mean, like Patty, who is charming to have about. Suppose
we keep her for the next year or two?"
</p>

<p>
"You will have to settle that with Patty and father.
And Patty has a way of breaking out of bounds that
might startle you. She is on her best behavior now."
</p>

<p>
"And we cannot always keep up to the mark&mdash;is that
what you mean me to infer?"
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't, I am sure, if the mark was set high," and
she laughed. "It is, up to grandmamma's. And Dolly,
who really is my aunt, you know, is not much older than I
am. We have royal times when she comes to the plantation.
But grandpapa is very strict and of the old&mdash;there's
a French word I ought to use," and she blushed.
"My French will not always come to the front; and so,
you see, I cannot put on grand airs."
</p>

<p>
Carrington laughed. Her frankness was so piquant.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Régime</i>&mdash;that I think is the word you want."
</p>

<p>
"Yes. A man who believes we have had no manners
since the days of Washington and Mr. John Adams. Oh,
do you truly think the country will go to ruin and split
up into fragments?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I really do not. Young countries, like young
people, make mistakes. Well, older countries do likewise.
There have been many changes in the policies of all
governments, many rulers. I've quite decided this will
last my time out."
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand about the Non-Intercourse Act
and all that. Father thinks it would be good for the
women not to get so much finery from abroad. But,
then, if we sell tobacco and other things to England and
France&mdash;why, it seems to me it is a good thing, a sort of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_73' name='Page_73'>[73]</a></span>
give and take. And grandpapa thinks Mr. Madison will
finish what Mr. Jefferson began, and that England will
get hold of us again. Are you to go to the levee?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes."
</p>

<p>
"I am so glad! I am to make a real bow to Mrs. Madison.
Oh, no; I suppose it is a courtesy. I like to see
people dressed up in pretty clothes, and I have not been to
the White House yet. And to see all the grand men
nearby, not simply in a jostling crowd. Don't you sometimes
feel a little afraid of them?"
</p>

<p>
There was a charming half-curiosity in her eyes, and
a pretty smile quivered about her red lips. What a child
she was! If he was to ask her to marry him both mother
and grandmother would be quite content. As for him&mdash;well,
he had no drawing toward matrimony, but that innate
chivalry and admiration for all women so common in
the men of that day, who were trained to pay the highest
respect to their mothers.
</p>

<p>
"I find myself wishing I was as wise and as experienced,
and had the clear insight that some of our best
men have had, nay, have to-day. But that comes with age
and profound knowledge."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't get any older! I like the young men. And
as for wisdom&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She paused and colored, turning her face half away,
but the roundness of the young cheek and the graceful
curve where it softly lost itself in the white neck were
truly lovely.
</p>

<p>
"We will dismiss wisdom and age," laughingly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, where are we going!" She reigned her horse in
sudden alarm.
</p>

<p>
"This is the last of the ravine. I wanted you to see
the picture beyond. Nay, there is nothing to fear."
</p>

<p>
The frowning rocks and overhanging trees on both
sides almost shut out the daylight. It did quite in summer
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_74' name='Page_74'>[74]</a></span>
when the foliage was thick. Then it lightened, and
the clear whistle of a bird rang out as if heralding the end.
The break was almost a level. The creek broadened out
here. The westward sun struck it and made beautiful
reflections on the undulating stretches of land. The leafless
trees showed golden and brown-red tints through the
dun haze, the birches wore a rosy silver light. Back of it
the hills rose with the mysterious suggestiveness of coming
spring, full of quivering lights as the wind made perceptible
waves in the air.
</p>

<p>
"It is wonderful!" she said softly. "It is like those
emotions one can never describe, that penetrate every
nerve, that make you feel half awed. Oh, the world is
beautiful!"
</p>

<p>
The eager, yet chastened, expression of her face moved
him. She sat her horse finely, girl as she was, her head
proudly erect, her shoulders in the velvet coat shaped exquisitely,
the sleeve showing the arm's perfect roundness
at the top and the slope down to the slender waist.
</p>

<p>
He had meant to call her attention to this scene, but
her quickness of vision gratified him.
</p>

<p>
"It is my favorite prospect," he said. "I have watched
it many a time just at this hour in the afternoon. From
early spring to midwinter the sun makes a picture of it.
We are rich in beautiful scenery, and when we are done
fighting and quarreling we should be a nation of artists.
So far we have only been inspired to portraits."
</p>

<p>
"It would be curious to be able to paint a picture. I
never thought of it before."
</p>

<p>
"That is genius, I suppose. Now, here is a nice clear
bit of road. Let us have a sharp canter out to that bend
in the creek and back, then we must hasten home before
the evening dampness sets in."
</p>

<p>
Daphne threw up her head at the touch of the whip, and
was off like a flash. Roger Carrington allowed her to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_75' name='Page_75'>[75]</a></span>
reach the bend first, to the discomfiture of Ajax. Jaqueline
turned her bright, rosy face, full of smiling triumph.
</p>

<p>
"I accept," nodding with gallantry. "We should have
been timed to a second. You are an excellent rider."
</p>

<p>
"Seeing that I have been trained from babyhood it
would be disgraceful if I were not. Oh, what crazy
things we have done&mdash;Louis and I! And then we would
bind ourselves by a solemn promise not to betray each
other. Children must have charmed lives!"
</p>

<p>
"You are hardly out of childhood yet."
</p>

<p>
"Wait until you see me in the gorgeousness of a train
and a top-knot. You will wonder at my dignity. Perhaps
you will not recognize me. The gown is pink. That may
be some help."
</p>

<p>
"Pink. The pink roses are the sweetest, I believe."
</p>

<p>
She nodded with a spice of coquetry.
</p>

<p>
"And now are we to crawl through this dismal glade?
Think of Indians lying in ambush!"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, do not spoil a pleasant ride by such a grewsome
suggestion."
</p>

<p>
He led the way, and they soon emerged to the open
again. The Capital loomed up; the scattered houses
made quite a show, after all.
</p>

<p>
That evening Roger and she were partners at whist
against his mother and grandmother, and the ladies won.
</p>

<p>
The next day the girls went over to Washington.
</p>

<p>
"I wish your visit could have been longer," Mrs. Carrington
said. "I should have enjoyed asking in the
young people about here and having a dance."
</p>

<p>
Patricia was very sorry. She had been on the extreme
confines of young-ladyhood.
</p>

<p>
"It was just delightful!" Jaqueline explained to Mrs.
Jettson. "Both ladies are lovely, but Madam is grand
and holds you in a little awe. She looks like some old
picture stepped out of a frame. And they are just crazy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_76' name='Page_76'>[76]</a></span>
over girls&mdash;no, you cannot imagine such stately ladies being
crazy over anything. They made so much of Patty
that she put on airs."
</p>

<p>
"I'm almost as tall as you, Miss Jaqueline!"
</p>

<p>
"But you would look ridiculous with a train and your
hair done up high, and a mincing step&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I didn't think that you minced very much!" interrupted
the younger. "I saw you run down the garden
walk, and Mr. Ralph said&mdash;" making a sudden halt.
</p>

<p>
"Well, <i>what</i> did he say?"
</p>

<p>
Patty paused, for she recalled the fact that Mr. Ralph's
comment had been distinctly complimentary.
</p>

<p>
"Don't dispute, girls. Patty, you are nothing but a
child, if you are tall, and you know you wouldn't like to
give up racing and climbing and dancing to old Sam's fiddle.
You girls do have the best of everything, while poor
Dolly and Marian&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad grandpapa isn't any real relation to me!"
exclaimed Patricia. "I like father a million times
better."
</p>

<p>
"That comes of being a bachelor when you are married.
I'm sure an old maid couldn't be any queerer. But then
Mr. Madison is said to be very indulgent to his wife, and
I'm sure he treats her like a prince. And father seems to
be just as bitter against him as he was against Mr. Jefferson.
It seems to me the world goes around just the
same, no matter who is President. Mr. Ralston came in
this morning and begged me to send for Marian. I
couldn't tell him exactly <i>why</i>; and I'm sure I wish Mrs.
Greaves was back again, and there wouldn't be any look
for Marian."
</p>

<p>
"Lieutenant Ralston was over to the Carringtons' a
while last evening," said Jaqueline, and somehow she
flushed in a quick manner that surprised herself, then
added&mdash;"Mr. Carrington will be at the levee."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_77' name='Page_77'>[77]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Oh, of course. It will be a fine affair. And Congress
will adjourn so soon, I doubt if there will be another.
There are to be state dinners to the Cabinet and the diplomats,
but next winter there will no doubt be many gayeties.
Jaqueline, you must run to bed and get your beauty
sleep, there is no knowing how late we will be up to-morrow
night."
</p>

<p>
"I think Jane might feel a little sorry that I can't go,"
said Patty lugubriously, as they were preparing for bed.
"It's Marian all the time."
</p>

<p>
"You don't understand, Patty&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes I do. That handsome young Mr. Ralston is in
love with her, and grandpapa is going to make her marry
that old Mr. Greaves because he has a big farm next to
his. I'd marry the man I liked."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense! I'm not thinking about marrying."
</p>

<p>
"Jaqueline, would you marry Mr. Roger?"
</p>

<p>
"I've understood that it was good manners to wait until
you were asked," turning to hide a blush.
</p>

<p>
"I mean to marry someone," answered the younger.
</p>

<p>
"Sleep on it first, Patty."
</p>

<p>
The next afternoon the hairdresser came and added
much state to Mrs. Jettson's appearance. There was
pearl powder, a luxury to be indulged in only on great
occasions. And though rouge was used, Mrs. Jettson
had enough color of her own, and Jaqueline was resplendent
with youth and health.
</p>

<p>
This affair was in the state drawing room, which had
grown rather shabby. Congress was considering an appropriation
of five thousand dollars for refurnishing.
The sofas were stiff, faded, and worn threadbare, and the
window hangings were limp and had lost their color. But
the light from the numerous candles softened and relieved
the impairment of time.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Madison was in the yellow velvet; new gowns
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_78' name='Page_78'>[78]</a></span>
were not considered necessary for every occasion. Her
beautiful neck and arms, which still kept the roundness
of early womanhood, were adorned with strings of pearls,
the short puffed sleeves rendered still prettier by a fall of
exquisite lace. The skirt was drawn aside and displayed
a white satin petticoat embroidered with gold thread,
and her slippers were adorned with buckles that almost
covered her dainty feet.
</p>

<p>
About her were arranged the members of the official
family, the ladies on one side, the gentlemen on the other.
It was quite a little court. Most of the senators and the
wives who were brave enough to give up home comforts
to spend a winter in Washington had already met Mrs.
Madison; indeed, by this time there were not many among
the strangers who had not been presented.
</p>

<p>
And so Miss Jaqueline Mason made her bow to the
first lady of the land and glancing up with a quick rift of
color caught the cordial smile that came with a warm
clasp of the hand.
</p>

<p>
"You have a good old Virginian name," she said.
"Many of us are proud to call it home. It is my second
home, the first in my affection now," and she gave the
child another sweet smile.
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline was more abashed than she had thought possible.
She stepped aside in a little confusion.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, here is Mr. Carrington. Shall I commend this
young lady to your care? There are some places she
might like to see and some curiosities. You are so much
at home here."
</p>

<p>
Roger Carrington bowed. Mrs. Jettson had found a
friend in the wife of one of the more recent senators, and
they were having a little chat, as it was that lady's first
visit to Washington to attend the inauguration. So Roger
slipped the fair hand within his arm, and they began a
tour of the still unfurnished White House, though much
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_79' name='Page_79'>[79]</a></span>
nearer completion and in a better state than Abigail
Adams had found it in her brief sojourn.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Madison's tact and grace had brought about a
more congenial state of affairs even while wife of the
secretary of state. There was in the conduct of both
men and women a trifle of formality verging to a certain
grandeur, yet gracious and truly courteous. There was
no mad rush then for the first places.
</p>

<p>
Presently the company broke up into chatty little groups.
Jaqueline found herself quite a center in the midst of
other centers. Here were two or three elderly men who
had known her father. She saw a young neighbor in
the throng whose eyes expressed so much amazement that
she could not help smiling. Lieutenant Ralston had come
in his soldier trappings, and there was quite a sprinkling
of military men, with others in the Continental costume
that gave such a picturesque aspect.
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline had a fresh, girlish charm, and to-night she
certainly looked lovely. Women and girls, when they were
admitted to society, were expected to make themselves
agreeable. No abstruse learning was required, and
though they might have strong political preferences they
were delicately veiled. Mrs. Madison had gone through
four years of unusual stress, and the few enemies she had
made were only those who envied her popularity. She
had been discretion itself outwardly, and her opinions,
her conferences, and her advice had been lodged only in
her husband's bosom.
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline had no care, no experience to conceal, and she
had already tried her prentice hand on the students at
Williamsburg. And that natural art of making men
pleased with themselves, that charming deference, so
great a factor in that day, was hers in an eminent degree.
Roger Carrington watched her as she caught up the
merry badinage and returned it with gay sparkles, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_80' name='Page_80'>[80]</a></span>
the pretty air that was half girlish demureness, the other
half the indefinable charm of budding womanhood.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant Ralston took her in to the refreshment table
set in the large dining room.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder when you will see Miss Floyd?" he began
in a low tone. "I hoped to the last moment that Mrs.
Jettson could persuade her parents to let her sister come
for a few days. You go to the Pineries quite often?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, yes&mdash;some of us. Father has a truly fervent
regard for grandmamma, and the girls come down frequently.
They like better to come to us, I think. There
is no real fun in staying at the Pineries. Of course when
we were children we went dutifully."
</p>

<p>
She gave a soft, light laugh.
</p>

<p>
Ralston was considering. "Mrs. Jettson would be
likely to know&mdash;of a visit?" hesitatingly.
</p>

<p>
"She might&mdash;if we sent her the word."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if you will ever feel friendly enough to invite
me? I like your father extremely. I was very glad
to have the opportunity of meeting him. And your
mother. You know we are all interested in Kentucky
just now."
</p>

<p>
"I think my parents would give you a very pleasant
visit," Jaqueline said with a grave yet encouraging smile.
The sort of conspiracy interested her. It was quite
tempting to be able to hold out a hand of encouragement
to Marian, who hated the dull life at the Pineries and did
so enjoy amusement. Then, a real love affair thrilled
Jaqueline with a delightful sensation.
</p>

<p>
He was considering how to obtain the invitation honorably,
when she furnished the key.
</p>

<p>
"I think you would like my brother Louis," she remarked
with a becoming shade of diffidence that went to
his heart, it wore such a charming air of innocence. "He
will be home in the early summer, and he always comes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_81' name='Page_81'>[81]</a></span>
up to Mrs. Jettson's at once. Arthur takes a great interest
in him. He is to study law and the science of government,
if there is such a science. Father has an eye to the
Presidency for him, I think."
</p>

<p>
They both laughed at that.
</p>

<p>
"The summer is a long way off," he commented rather
despondingly.
</p>

<p>
"The robins are singing and violets are in bloom. At
home, no doubt, I shall find trailing arbutus."
</p>

<p>
"They are spring indications."
</p>

<p>
"You are hard to satisfy."
</p>

<p>
"Am I? Well, I would rather have that reputation
than one of being pleased with trifles."
</p>

<p>
"Sometimes the trifles prove very agreeable."
</p>

<p>
Mr. and Mrs. Cutts, Mrs. Madison's favorite sister,
came sauntering slowly down with a bevy of friends,
greeting many of the guests. She paused and glanced at
Jaqueline. There was some of the charming affability
about her that characterized the wife of the President.
Indeed, she had been trained on the same lines.
</p>

<p>
"I should like to be certain of this young lady's name.
I did not quite catch it when she was introduced," Mrs.
Cutts said in a tone that was complimentary in itself.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant Ralston presented his companion, who in
turn was presented to several other notables.
</p>

<p>
"Mason," she repeated. "Yes, I should guess you
were a Virginian. My sister, you know, adores her home
at Montpellier. Are you anywhere in her vicinity? That
is, when she is in her true home? Though we have both
become endeared to this ugly, unfinished Washington
that we all have to look at by the eye of faith, and not
only that, but make our friends see through the same
lenses. Lieutenant Ralston, shall we ever have a Capital
worthy of the nation?"
</p>

<p>
"That knowledge is not quite in my line," he returned
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_82' name='Page_82'>[82]</a></span>
laughingly. "If war should come it will be my business
to fight for it. And you can recall the old adage that
Rome was not built in a day. Is it a historical fact or a
Shaksperean apothegm? If the fact, we can take courage
and go on."
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course it took centuries to build imperial
Rome," and Mrs. Cutts' eyes twinkled with amusement.
</p>

<p>
"But they were always tearing down, you remember.
Every emperor demolished so much that his predecessor
had done. There must have been a good deal to start
with."
</p>

<p>
"And we started with nothing. I wonder anyone had
the courage to leave lovely, refined, and gay Philadelphia
for this desert! Now, if the tent had even been pitched
in Baltimore it would have been more appropriate."
</p>

<p>
"But, you see, when we built a country we wanted to
try our hand at building a Capital to match. It will be
fine enough when it is done, in a dozen years or so. And
it unites the warring factions. One city cannot be jealous
of another."
</p>

<p>
"Miss Mason, this young man bewilders me and leads
me astray. See what it is to be a soldier and a patriot.
Now I am going to carry you off and introduce you to
some girls. Are you going to stay long enough to go to a
ball? Every Virginia girl dances."
</p>

<p>
She was so bright and pretty that Mrs. Cutts was oddly
interested in her.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I adore dancing and riding! But I am afraid&mdash;my
father is to send for me in a few days. If he were
coming himself I might beg off. Your suggestion is so
tempting."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you can. Now, here are some young people
you must know," and turning away from the elders she
introduced Jaqueline to a merry group.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Mason and I are old friends," declared Roger
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_83' name='Page_83'>[83]</a></span>
Carrington with a smile. "She has been visiting with
us and left us inconsolable."
</p>

<p>
"Quite a compliment to your charms."
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline blushed. "Or to the delightful hospitality
of Madam and Mrs. Carrington. My sister was with me,
and she was quite melancholy. We did have a charming
visit. I am afraid we shall be so spoiled that our Virginia
wilds will prove desert wastes."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Carrington, you must manage to keep Miss Mason
over. The Dearborns are to give the young people a
ball. We want it to be the event of the season, and that
will soon be ended, alas! And we must gather the beauty
and the chivalry."
</p>

<p>
There was quite a gay little whirl for some moments
and more merry badinage. More than one envious
eye was cast upon the young girl, for Roger Carrington
was considered one of the prizes in the matrimonial
market. Sir Augustus Foster, who was secretary of the
English Legation some years before, had said there was
no lack of handsome women, and that he never saw
prettier girls anywhere, and that the City was one of the
most marrying places on the whole continent.
</p>

<p>
"We missed you so very much," Roger began, when he
had detached her a little from the group. "I had half a
mind to come and confiscate one of you."
</p>

<p>
"Patty would have been glad enough."
</p>

<p>
"But <i>you</i> were full of pleasure! Perhaps we seemed
dull to you? We are rather quiet folk."
</p>

<p>
He uttered the pronoun quite decisively, so much so
that it brought the color to her cheek.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, it was not dull! I enjoyed it extremely."
</p>

<p>
"And if you stay for the ball will you not come over
again? Mother liked you both so much. You will find
it delightful at the Dearborns'. And I shall claim some
dances."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_84' name='Page_84'>[84]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"You will hardly be crowded out, in that happy event,"
she returned brightly.
</p>

<p>
Then there were some other introductions to noted
people. Colonel Monroe was standing by, and shared
them. Mrs. Madison came presently, leaning on Mr.
Clinton's arm.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you have had a pleasant time," the lady said
graciously; "and that we shall see you frequently. I am
very fond of young people."
</p>

<p>
"I felt as if I ought to kiss her hand," Jaqueline whispered,
with a scarlet face, to her companion. "That is the
obeisance people are expected to pay to a queen."
</p>

<p>
"Not in a republic. And every lady is a queen to a
man at some period of her life."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mr. Carrington! no one would suspect you of
such a pretty speech."
</p>

<p>
"Wouldn't they? Do I look as if I had no courteous
speeches at my command?"
</p>

<p>
He looked very handsome and winning at that moment.
</p>

<p>
The company was breaking up. People came and went
early on these occasions. Mrs. Jettson hunted up her
charge.
</p>

<p>
"I declare, Jaqueline, you have been one of the belles
of the evening. Such a mere chit, too! And you looked
very grand parading around with Ralston and Mr. Carrington.
Poor Marian! It is a shame she couldn't have
been here. And, Jaqueline, please don't forget that Lieutenant
Ralston in a way belongs to her."
</p>

<p>
The tone was rather sharp, but Jaqueline was too happy
to resent it. Other young men had noticed her, as well.
</p>

<p>
"He does not forget it. He was very sorry she was
not here," Jaqueline replied after a moment.
</p>

<p>
The well-trained maid helped them on with their wraps,
and the footman found their carriage.
</p>

<p>
Yes, Jaqueline was a pretty girl, Jane ruminated; but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_85' name='Page_85'>[85]</a></span>
so much attention would soon turn her head. She was
proud of her, and yet a little jealous for her sister's sake,
who could enjoy pleasure quite as well. And Lieutenant
Ralston was in the way of promotion, if he was not rich.
</p>

<p>
The very next day a message came from Mr. Mason. A
friend would be in Washington on Monday, and Tuesday
morning they must be ready to start home with him. It
was too late to get word back, and Jane took it for
granted that they must go. Jaqueline gave a sigh and
was minded to shed a few tears, but on Saturday Mrs.
Carrington drove over for the girls to spend the Sunday
with them.
</p>

<p>
"Try and not be too coquettish, Jaqueline. It makes
a young girl seem very forward," Mrs. Jettson advised.
</p>

<p>
"Jane is growing unpleasant," Jaqueline thought to
herself. "She wants Marian in everything."
</p>

<p>
However, after the ball and one more levee there was
not much gayety in the City. Congress adjourned, senators
and representatives went home to consider at their
leisure the grave questions pending. Mrs. Madison was
much engrossed in the judicious use of the grant Congress
had made. There were some new mirrors set, some
dining-room furniture and china, new curtains and hangings,
and upholstery done in gorgeous brocaded yellow
satin. Still further, there was added a pianoforte; and
the President ordered a chariot in Philadelphia for his
wife, and the two horses were increased to four. The
White House was to make a character for itself.

</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">THE BEGINNING OF A LOVE STORY.</span>
</h2>

<p>
"Why, you can just ask him down as you do any other
friend," said Jaqueline with an air of innocence.
"I half promised he should have the invitation. You will
like him ever so much. <i>I</i> like him," laughingly.
</p>

<p>
"But Polly is coming&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't ever let grandfather hear that 'Polly,' or he
won't even leave you enough to buy a mourning ring.
He thinks so highly of old English customs. What a
chum he would have been for Sir Charles Grandison!
Are people born too late or too early! What are you
smiling at?"
</p>

<p>
"The way you leap from one thing to another."
</p>

<p>
"Which shows a variety of wit and knowledge, young
collegian. Didn't Shakspere call it nimble wit? I have
learned a great many things since I saw you last."
</p>

<p>
"In an hour?" incredulously, and Louis raised his fine
brows.
</p>

<p>
"One might learn many things in an hour. And now,
Mr. Tender Conscience, don't worry about Polly, as you
have taken to calling her. She may come, and she may
not. And if she comes she may be sent for the very next
day. The Fairfaxes are sure to come; they have accepted.
I warn you that Betty is a dreadful coquette.
And Georgie Baker, and the Carringtons&mdash;at least Roger.
And he is great friends with Mr. Ralston."
</p>

<p>
"But we must not get in a row with grandfather.
And a girl who hasn't spunk enough to stand up for the
man she loves&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps she isn't really in love with him. That ought
to give any girl courage&mdash;to run some risks."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_87' name='Page_87'>[87]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;I'm off. A long and sad farewell," and the
young man assumed a tragic air.
</p>

<p>
"Very good," she returned gravely. "Does a young
man appreciate his inestimable privileges when he has a
sister on whom he can practice?"
</p>

<p>
He laughed and kissed her. Jaqueline went to her
room and wrote a very properly worded letter to Marian.
Maum Chloe had two new pudding recipes that were delicious.
She had the latest sleeve pattern, and Madam
Weare had been to spend the day, and wore such a lovely
cap that she was quite sure grandmamma would like it.
They had concocted one out of some old mull, the torn
breadth of a gown, and Marian could take it home. Then
Elizabeth Fairfax was making some of the prettiest
darned lace, a Vandyke cape that was just coming in, and
she would be here for a few days next week. If Marian
could come down, even if she could only stay one
night. The week afterward there would be an influx of
company. It would be just delightful to have her and
Dolly then&mdash;perhaps they <i>might</i> be able to come&mdash;but
Marian had better come and stay over. They would not
want to be poking over lace-making and all that when
there was lots of fun going on.
</p>

<p>
Shrewd as Grandmother Floyd was she fell into the
trap so adroitly set by this flighty young person.
</p>

<p>
"Madam Weare is very genteel in her tastes and is not
given to foolish things because they are new. I hardly
know anyone who dresses so suitably. I do think Louis
or Jaqueline might have ridden up. And I do not see
what Patricia is about, or your uncle either, to let Jaqueline
have her head so much. She ought to be learning
something useful. The Fairfaxes are well enough, a
nice family, and Elizabeth is a very well-behaved girl&mdash;industrious,
too. But I'd like to see the lace
Jaqueline will make!" with a strong touch of scorn
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_88' name='Page_88'>[88]</a></span>
in her voice, and a slight lifting of the nose to make
it more emphatic.
</p>

<p>
"The Vandyke capes are very pretty and graceful.
Mrs. Lee brought one from Paris, and it cost a fortune,"
remarked Marian. "And darned net&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I think I know what it is. Of course it is the pattern
and the amount of work that makes it valuable. You
might do one through the course of the summer,
Marian."
</p>

<p>
"If I knew how"&mdash;and the girl gave a little sigh.
</p>

<p>
"Let me see the letter." Marian had been reading it
aloud. "I don't know but you <i>might</i> go, but I don't care
to have you in the rabble of the week after. It would be
a grand thing if that young Carrington would fancy
Jaqueline and she would have sense enough to accept him.
But such girls go through the woods and take a crooked
stick at last."
</p>

<p>
Nothing more was said for a day or two. Marian
found an old engraving of a Vandyke collar and cuffs,
only they were done in point lace. What kind of net
was used, she wondered. And then her mother decided
she would go down for the day and leave Marian for a
night or two. But grandfather had a poorly spell, and
she thought it best not to leave him. Marian rode her
horse down, attended by old Cato, who had to go to
Alexandria on some business and would escort her home
on the third day.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, good gracious!" cried Jaqueline; "if she <i>had</i>
come! For the rabble is here already, and someone <i>you</i>
will like to see. They've gone off fishing. Betty and
Hester Fairfax and Georgie Baker are out on the west
porch. We're in for a good time. Mr. Ralston and
Roger Carrington came down with Louis, and to-night
we are going to have a little dance."
</p>

<p>
"Mother approves of Elizabeth Fairfax. And I <i>do</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_89' name='Page_89'>[89]</a></span>
want to know about the Vandyke cape and the cap pattern.
Oh, Jacky!"
</p>

<p>
Marian clasped her arms about her cousin, and the
obnoxious name was forgiven. For the warm pressure
was full of gratitude.
</p>

<p>
"You are so wise about things, Jaqueline. Of course
mother sees all our letters&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"As if I didn't know that," laughed Jaqueline.
</p>

<p>
"But I wonder&mdash;oh, Jaqueline, do you suppose I will
have to marry Mr. Greaves? You see, father has set his
heart upon it. And I should be so near them, and so&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The idea! A man double your age, and four children!
You don't even like him. What is youth for but
a time to be merry and glad and to have good times?
And it was a shame you could not come to Washington!
Lieutenant Ralston would have taken you everywhere,
and Jane was up to white heat about it. It was all splendid.
You're not engaged&mdash;you can't have been so
foolish!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Jaqueline! I wish I had your&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Spunk!" Jaqueline exclaimed with a laugh, while
Marian was considering.
</p>

<p>
"You see, no one really governs you. Your father is
so indulgent."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't have quite everything my own way, I
assure you! But what have <i>you</i> done in this matter?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, Mr. Greaves has explained to father and
mother. Of course he will not say anything to me until
the year is up. He is very punctilious, and I am so glad
he believes in the year. He comes over and we have a
game of whist, which I hate, and get out of when there is
other company. But father expects me to stay in the
room. Occasionally he questions me about something&mdash;household
affairs generally. Mrs. Greaves was an excellent
housekeeper&mdash;much superior to his sister, he thinks."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_90' name='Page_90'>[90]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Marian! I should die if I had to marry such a
man. Come, let us go down to the girls and forget all
about him. Cassy will put away your things."
</p>

<p>
Marian lingered.
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;what else?" impatiently. "You don't really
want to tell me that you have a fancy for this wretched
old fellow?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, no! But, Jaqueline&mdash;of course I did not
know Mr. Ralston would be here, yet I had a sort of presentiment
that you had planned something. And is it
quite fair, do you think? I mean honest to&mdash;to enjoy it
all? I am afraid he likes me."
</p>

<p>
"I am quite sure he does. But I wasn't sure of his
coming. Louis met him at Jane's, and likes him immensely.
There are other girls here&mdash;it isn't at all as if
you were the only guest. Don't worry, but let matters
take their course. Come and see the lace-making."
</p>

<p>
The three girls welcomed Marian warmly. Elizabeth
Fairfax was nearly her own age, Hester younger, and
Georgie Jaqueline's compeer and near neighbor. Elizabeth
had a sweet Madonna face, with large, downcast eyes
and a soft, deferential voice, but the eyes did ready execution
on the hearts of the young men. She was always
busy about something, and it was a study to watch her
hands, they were so shapely and beautiful.
</p>

<p>
Georgie was recounting amusing episodes, and in a few
moments they were all laughing and talking. A table
near by was loaded with fruit and cake, and a pitcher of
homemade "shrub" gave them a delectable nectar.
Betty had attended the inauguration, and as Marian listened
her heart grew hot and rebellious that she should
have been kept from the pleasure. She and her sister had
been trained to a sharp obedience, kept in bonds like very
children. Mr. Floyd had never cordially approved of
his son-in-law. He considered it almost a crime to have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_91' name='Page_91'>[91]</a></span>
been born north of Baltimore, and Mr. Jettson had grown
up in northern New York, and to some extent made his
own fortune. Jane had gone to Philadelphia for a year's
schooling with an old friend of Mrs. Floyd's and come
home engaged. Mr. Jettson had a business proffer in
Washington, and somehow the marriage was pushed
through in haste. Mr. Floyd had an objection to new
people, to business people, to the manner in which things
were being conducted at Washington, and to the Jefferson
party generally. But he was fond of his daughter,
and though he would not have confessed it he did admire
her style, her knowledge of the City, and the fact
that she was in the best society. But, after all, a large
landed estate gave a man true dignity. Mr. Greaves
agreed with him in politics, was of good old stock, and
had aristocratic tastes, while Arthur Jettson really was
plebeian. Since there was an opportunity Marian should
marry to his liking.
</p>

<p>
"I've been telling about your cape, Betty, and Marian
wants to know how to do it. Spread it out. There, isn't
that lovely?"
</p>

<p>
The Brussels net was fine, and the flowers were made
in outline and filled in with stitches that seemed a little
raised, they were so close together, and had a satin-like
effect. The shape was very graceful, with the points at
the shoulders and in front.
</p>

<p>
Fine needlework and lace-making were much esteemed.
For years imported articles had been very high, besides
the difficulty of getting them unless one went abroad.
Beautiful specimens have come down to us, and one wonders
at the patience and taste, when there were so many
cares to life. Occasionally a slave woman evinced a
peculiar genius for this delicate work, and the family considered
her quite a treasure.
</p>

<p>
"It is exquisite!" declared Marian, who was no mean
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_92' name='Page_92'>[92]</a></span>
needlewoman herself. Indeed, the work rather bewitched
her. "Oh, I really must have one! But it will take a
great deal of time."
</p>

<p>
"Why, you see I have mine three-quarters done, and
I take it up at odd spells and when I go visiting. And it
is very easy when you once get started. You see, you follow
the pattern in outlining. Then, some of my leaves
and flowers are not wholly filled, and it has a very pretty
effect, making a variety and less work. Jaqueline, can't
you find a bit of lace; and Marian may outline this end of
the pattern, and I can show her some of the stitches before
the boys come home. We are going to ride then, I
believe, and dance in the evening. We improve all our
time when we are over here."
</p>

<p>
"I shall be delighted," returned Marian. Jaqueline
found some lace, and Marian went at the work eagerly.
They spiced the employment with merry gossip and
laughter and bits of teasing. The squire and Mrs. Mason
came home from a business drive to a neighboring
town. They had taken the two little girls for to-day;
Varina had been in a most amiable mood. Then the
fishermen returned, rather disgusted with their want of
luck.
</p>

<p>
"You know we did not want you to go," and Elizabeth
raised her soft, reproving eyes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ralston came around to Marian's side.
</p>

<p>
"This is a pleasant surprise. I was hoping all the
time. Only Miss Mason is such a torment. She was
quite sure you wouldn't come. We almost quarreled
about it this morning. And yet she is a charming girl.
This house is the very embodiment of comfort and delight.
I suppose you know I met the Masons at the inauguration?
Oh, you can't think how disappointed I
was! I had counted so on seeing you."
</p>

<p>
Marian Floyd glanced in the speaker's eyes and hers
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_93' name='Page_93'>[93]</a></span>
fell, while a fluttering color crept up her face and her
whole body seemed to thrill as at the touch of some subtle
magnetism. She suddenly wished he would go away;
he seemed to take the strength out of her.
</p>

<p>
"Are you glad to see me?" in a breathless sort of way
that seemed to demand an affirmative.
</p>

<p>
"Yes." She did not mean to say it. The word came
of its own accord. It was almost as if she had answered
it to another question.
</p>

<p>
"Come, fellows," began Louis, "let us drop our plebeian
garb, with its ancient, fishlike smell."
</p>

<p>
"That's good, considering there wasn't fish enough to
make any sort of smell. Keep truth on your side."
</p>

<p>
"And misquoting Shakspere, when it has been presented
to us all winter in every aspect! Williamsburg
has had a feast or a surfeit from college exercises to strolling
players&mdash;some very good ones, too. Jaqueline, have
you ordered the horses?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, no!"
</p>

<p>
"Then go at once, while we make ourselves beautiful.
We shall not have too much time."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Carrington had gone immediately to his room,
and came down as Jaqueline was going through the
hall.
</p>

<p>
"The fishing was not much of a success. I would
rather have sat under the trees and talked to you. Ah,
here is your father."
</p>

<p>
When they had greeted each other Jaqueline explained
her errand.
</p>

<p>
"Let us all go out together!" exclaimed Mr. Carrington.
"My poor fellow will be glad to see me."
</p>

<p>
"Marian must have a fresh horse; she rode hers all the
way down. Oh, there are the Johnsons! Just in time
for the fray," and she nodded over to two young men
sauntering up the avenue.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_94' name='Page_94'>[94]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Jaqueline, you ride the mare and give Marian your
pony. I will go out and see to things."
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline turned back, and the two young men gallantly
dismounted, escorting her to the porch, where soon the
five girls assembled in equestrian array, and the five cavaliers
were at their service.
</p>

<p>
"Do not stay out too late," admonished the squire.
</p>

<p>
Marian hesitated. Louis led off with Elizabeth, who
was much amused at the young collegian's aplomb. Hester
was supposed to have a more than friendly interest in
the elder Johnson brother. Mr. Carrington kept close to
Jaqueline, and Ralston wheeled his horse around to
Marian's side.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if there is a little fate in that?" and the
squire nodded to the last couple. "Father has other
plans for Marian."
</p>

<p>
"You don't mean that he is in real earnest about that
widower and the houseful of children?" inquired Mrs.
Mason.
</p>

<p>
"And you did not hesitate at five!" smiling humorously.
</p>

<p>
"I <i>did</i> hesitate. I think you can never know how
much. But I was older and more experienced, and a
good deal in love with the father of the children," flushing
girlishly, "while Marian shrinks from Mr. Greaves. I do
not think he would attract any young girl. Jane feels
dreadfully about it. I like Lieutenant Ralston very
much myself."
</p>

<p>
"He is a fine fellow, but not really abounding in this
world's goods, and that goes a great way with father."
</p>

<p>
"Suppose it were Jaqueline?"
</p>

<p>
"I had rather it would be Carrington."
</p>

<p>
"But if she loved him?"
</p>

<p>
"I do not think Marian is in love with anybody. I
suppose I am too lax, but father Floyd is too rigid. And
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_95' name='Page_95'>[95]</a></span>
mother upholds him. The girls have been trained to
obey. What will you do when Jaqueline refuses some
nice, suitable, prosperous young man and sets her heart
on a spendthrift&mdash;a ne'er-do-well?"
</p>

<p>
"Turn her over to her father."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Mason shrugged his shoulders, and his eyes
twinkled.
</p>

<p>
"And Annis?"
</p>

<p>
"That is going a long way off."
</p>

<p>
"But it isn't wisdom to throw Marian in temptation's
way when it can only bring about trouble."
</p>

<p>
"If Marian really fell in love that would solve the difficulty.
Youth ought to mate with youth. Then both
have the springtime of love. Did not you find it sweet?
Answer truly."
</p>

<p>
He smiled, and was silent a moment. Then he bent
over and kissed her.
</p>

<p>
"The summer has a richness as well. A cold, untoward
spring never makes a fruitful summer."
</p>

<p>
Then Mrs. Mason turned away to household cares.
Charles was walking under the larches with his arm about
Annis' waist. He was suddenly shooting up&mdash;a Mason
trick&mdash;and was taller than the little girl and very devoted
to her. Varina was upstairs trying on three different
newly ironed white frocks. Patricia had gone to visit
Aunt Catharine.
</p>

<p>
"Chloe, have you made preparations for a host at supper,
and a hungry host again about nine o'clock? I
should call it a party."
</p>

<p>
"Supper's all right. Dere's biskit 'nuff for a regimen'.
And cake by de bushel. Chloe see company afore in dis
ole house. De ham pink as a rose and de col' chicken
'nuff to make yer mouf water. An' cream an' jells an'
fruit. De young folks no need to go to bed hungry."
</p>

<p>
The mistress smiled.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_96' name='Page_96'>[96]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Jest take a peep at de table."
</p>

<p>
The snowy cloth, ironed to perfection, the quaint old
silver service, the sparkling glass and china of various
dates, and the great bowls of flowers made a picture.
Through the open windows came the soft low caroling
of birds calling each other home, and the tranquil noises
of a country evening were like wafts of music. How delightful
to be amongst it all, and at home! Yes, love was
the great evangel of human life.
</p>

<p>
The ride was most delightful. Gay young people seize
every salient point of enjoyment. They were a little late
to supper, which was a mirthful meal; then Sam and
Darius began to tune their fiddles on the porch, and some
young neighbors were added; and as no night was ever
too warm to dance, they had a merry time.
</p>

<p>
There was another long day of enjoyment to Marian
Floyd. They went down to the bank of the Potomac on
a picnic, with loads of provisions. They rambled about;
they had a lazy, drifting sail adown the shadiest bank;
they sang and jested, and went home gay, tired, happy,
full of the gladness of youth.
</p>

<p>
Marian was sharing Jaqueline's room from choice.
The latter had grown into young-ladyhood so rapidly
that it hardly seemed as if there was much difference in
their ages, even though Marian was so much more sedate,
and latterly had become rather timid.
</p>

<p>
"I have had such a good time!" she said with a sigh.
"I don't know when I have enjoyed anything so much.
There are so few young people around the Pineries.
Mother will be just delighted with that pudding, but
she will think I ought to have done more lacework. I
wonder if I will have time to finish that flower in the
morning?"
</p>

<p>
"You can get up early," suggested Jaqueline. "Very
early&mdash;for we are going for a canter before breakfast."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_97' name='Page_97'>[97]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;Cato can't get here before ten, I think. That
will be after breakfast."
</p>

<p>
"Then you can come to bed with a clear conscience.
I think I am asleep everywhere but the tip of my tongue
and a little spot in my brain."
</p>

<p>
"And&mdash;I wanted to talk to you."
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline tumbled into bed and squeezed up her pillow.
</p>

<p>
"Talk fast," she said good-humoredly.
</p>

<p>
Marian sat down on the side of the bed, combing her
hair and twisting it up in two soft coils. Then she put
on her nightcap, a dainty bit of lawn and ruffling, and
looked pretty enough to charm anyone.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what to do! Oh, Jacky, I am the happiest
girl and the most miserable girl alive!"
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline raised on her elbow, quite wide awake at the
admission.
</p>

<p>
"Did you guess that Lieutenant Ralston cared? It is
so&mdash;so wonderful to have a real lover, who can put his
meaning in his eyes and in the clasp of his hand, and make
you feel it all about you, just that way your father loves
your mother. All day to-day I have been in that curious
tremble; I wanted to look and I did not dare, and
then I looked in spite of myself. And this evening&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;I managed that you should go off by yourselves.
And now, Polly, you won't marry that Mr.
Greaves?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, what can I do? You see, father is set upon it.
And Mr. Ralston wants to come up and ask father, and I
didn't dare tell him about it, and don't know what to do."
</p>

<p>
"Why, let him come up. And if grandpapa won't give
in, I'd run away, that's all. Oh, Polly, I am so glad! It
must be just lovely! Though I do not want to be engaged
just yet. I like fun. And there are so many fine gentlemen
in Washington who say such pretty complimentary
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_98' name='Page_98'>[98]</a></span>
things and dance so beautifully, and Mrs. Carrington
expects me to make her a long visit next winter. I'd
rather have a dozen lovers than just one. But it is different
with you, and you are older; and at home grandmamma
treats you like a little child. Yes, I'd let him
come and have it over."
</p>

<p>
"But it would be awful. I never could get the courage
to tell; and if father was taken by surprise&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Why, I should say that a friend was coming&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But he knows that Mr. Ralston paid me a good deal
of attention when I was at Jane's, and that was why he
would not let me go to the inauguration. And if I were
to say he had been here two days, and I had ridden and
walked with him, and he had said&mdash;he did not ask me to
be engaged of course, until he had seen father."
</p>

<p>
"And what did you say? You couldn't refuse altogether?"
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid I said too much&mdash;that is, I let things go.
I love him and I don't dare to, all in the same breath. And
I know father will never let me marry him."
</p>

<p>
"But Jane married the man of her choice."
</p>

<p>
"There wasn't anyone else just then. And he thinks
Jane might have done much better. You see, Mr. Greaves
is there on the spot. And July will soon be here. Oh,
dear!"
</p>

<p>
Marian leaned down on Jaqueline's shoulder and cried
softly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I should be spunky! You are very sweet,
Marian, and you give up too easily. You haven't any
fight in you. They cannot force you to marry Mr.
Greaves. Fathers might have done that years ago; and
if you are firm and say you won't&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Jaqueline, don't talk all night," said an admonishing
voice.
</p>

<p>
Marian was very shy and reserved the next morning
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_99' name='Page_99'>[99]</a></span>
during the ride, but more deliciously sweet to her lover,
as the men of those days expected to really win their
sweethearts. After breakfast she packed up her recipes
and the cap pattern, and sewed industriously at her lacework.
Louis drove Georgie home, and then was to do an
errand for his father. The two young men were to go to
Washington presently. Roger Carrington planned for
the visit his mother was to make, and then they were to
return it and bring Annis. He had taken a great fancy
to the child.
</p>

<p>
There was only time for a brief farewell when Cato
came.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I write to your father, or come?" the lover inquired
in a decisive tone.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, wait&mdash;I will tell you!" Marian answered hurriedly,
frightened at the thought of the future, yet deliciously
happy.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">AN ANGRY FATHER.</span>
</h2>

<p>
Jaqueline was very busy paying visits and having a
good time. They had been up to the Pineries twice
without her. Truth to tell, she was a little afraid of her
own counsel, and hoping Marian would have spirit enough
to assert herself. One day she was very much surprised
by the advent of Mr. Ralston.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, honey; he jes' done ask to see you, not yer mar
ner ennyone! And he looks jes laik a lover comin' to de
house," announced Julia, one of the waiting-maids.
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline went down with a deeper flush on her cheek
and a beating heart. There was a courteous greeting,
and then a touch of embarrassment. Ralston was first to
surmount it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_100' name='Page_100'>[100]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Miss Mason," he began abruptly, "when have you
seen Miss Floyd?"
</p>

<p>
"Not since she was here. I have been away from
home. Papa and part of the family were up last week."
</p>

<p>
"Will you read this note?"
</p>

<p>
It was from Marian&mdash;very brief and cold. She had
considered the matter, and felt that it would be impossible
to keep up the acquaintance. It would be useless
either to come or to write.
</p>

<p>
"If Miss Floyd was merely amusing herself, of course
that is the end of it. Do you know whether she has a
lover? There was some mystery about her I could not
quite fathom. I may have been misled, but I thought she
cared for me. Indeed," he added, flushing a little and
softening his tone, "it seemed a case of mutual attraction
at first sight. We became such friends while she
was at her sister's."
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline considered a moment. Then she said: "I
had better tell you the whole story. And if you knew
grandpapa&mdash;he is as arbitrary as a king. He looks like
one too."
</p>

<p>
She recapitulated the advances of Mr. Greaves, and
admitted that Marian was yielding and stood in awe of
her father. "But I am quite certain she loves you," declared
the incautious girl.
</p>

<p>
"I felt rather certain," with a satisfied half-smile.
"And I can understand that Mr. Greaves is a rival not
to be despised. I have no broad acres nor ancestral home,
but youth and ambition and a good profession. Surely
when Mr. Floyd comes to understand, he cannot force
his daughter's inclinations! I will devote my whole life
to her, my best energies. I am sure I shall succeed."
</p>

<p>
"Marian never could resist him if she saw him now,"
Jaqueline thought, he looked so proud and so in earnest.
But Grandpapa Floyd!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_101' name='Page_101'>[101]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"You give me hope. You are young to advise anyone
in a love affair," and he laughed in a genial, amused
fashion. "I came here because you knew about those
two days, and I thought you might be more in Miss
Floyd's confidence than her sister, though I can count on
Mrs. Jettson's influence and approval, I am certain. Do
you think Miss Floyd may have told her father?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no; I am sure she has not. Only I do think some
influence has been brought to bear upon her, and she has
felt afraid&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline looked very pretty and spirited, standing up
straight and slim, her dark eyes aglow with earnestness
and eager interest. She would not be afraid to stand up
for her lover.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I go or write?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I am afraid to advise!" She turned pale then.
</p>

<p>
"And it is unmanly to ask it."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps papa could tell better."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if I might see him?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes. Will you amuse yourself while I find him?
Louis is away, and the children are having a picnic down
in the grove."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Mason was ensconced in a willow easy-chair, with
a high back and a cushion, while his wife was reading
aloud from the pages of Oliver Goldsmith. He glanced
up, and Jaqueline suddenly realized the gravity of the
matter in hand.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Ralston is here, and would like to see you,
papa!" she exclaimed persuasively.
</p>

<p>
"Ah&mdash;can't you bring him out here?"
</p>

<p>
"It is quite important and&mdash;" hesitatingly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I'll come." He reached for his coat, and sighed
at the added warmth.
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline slipped her hand through his arm.
</p>

<p>
"It's about&mdash;Marian."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_102' name='Page_102'>[102]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I was afraid there would be trouble. Jack, was their
meeting here pure accident? Tell me the truth. Or did
you have mischief in your mind?"
</p>

<p>
"It wasn't <i>quite</i> that. But Marian did not know. And
I did not really promise Mr. Ralston."
</p>

<p>
"I wish you had kept out of it, my girl."
</p>

<p>
"But Marian <i>does</i> love him. And surely grandpapa
will never make her marry that stupid old Mr.
Greaves!"
</p>

<p>
"Take care. I am getting old."
</p>

<p>
"But you will never be stupid." She reached up and
kissed him.
</p>

<p>
"You know grandfather is very fond of having his
own way. Mr. Greaves isn't so bad, when all is said."
</p>

<p>
"You wouldn't make me marry him?"
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid I would have a tough job," and he
laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Now I shall leave you to your own wisdom."
</p>

<p>
The squire nodded.
</p>

<p>
The young lover presented his case in a very straightforward,
honorable fashion. Mr. Mason's heart went out
to him, but he understood his stepfather's obstinacy and
his dislike to be meddled with or thwarted. His mother
was in favor of the marriage also, which would make it
harder for Marian.
</p>

<p>
"If you write to Mr. Floyd you will receive a polite
but decided dismissal. If you see him I am afraid the
result will be the same, and less pleasant to remember."
</p>

<p>
"Do you suppose I am coward enough to relinquish
the woman I love in such an emergency as this? If I
heard from her own lips that she did not care for me,
that would influence my conduct. But I am certain she
does care, and I want her to know that I am ready to take
any step for her happiness. I am too much of a soldier
to give up without an effort, even if I have seen only fair-weather
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_103' name='Page_103'>[103]</a></span>
service. What would you have done in your
youth?"
</p>

<p>
"Made a good fight," smiling at the other's eagerness.
</p>

<p>
"Then I shall go. To be merely dismissed would be
mortifying. And any woman would despise such a tame
lover! Thank you for your cordial reception. In any
event I shall count on your friendship."
</p>

<p>
He shook Mr. Mason's hand warmly.
</p>

<p>
"But you will stay and have some supper with us?
And why not accept our hospitality for the night?"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you. I have some important matters on hand
to-morrow morning. I am truly sorry not to have a
delightful evening with you, and I am indebted to you for
this kindly attention on a troublesome subject. I sincerely
trust that some day I shall stand in a nearer relation.
You can wish me success&mdash;I hope?"
</p>

<p>
The truth and honor in the lines of the face appealed to
the elder man. He had found so many charms in his
new wife, so much sweetness in the daily love, that he
could be generous in his wishes.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I hope you will succeed," and the squire said it
from the depth of his heart, although his latent judgment
was not so hopeful.
</p>

<p>
"He will go to the Pineries," he said as he rejoined his
wife and daughter. "It will not do any good, and I am
afraid we are in for a family fracas. Marian may refuse
to marry Mr. Greaves, but her father will not accept
Ralston. I am sorry. They would make a nice, happy
young couple."
</p>

<p>
"But she might wait a year or two."
</p>

<p>
"It isn't easy waiting when there is no real hope, and
the influence is all on the other side. You see, Grandfather
Floyd has trained his children to habits of obedience.
He isn't turned about with every wind of doctrine,
as I am. Not a child stands in awe of me. And when I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_104' name='Page_104'>[104]</a></span>
pick out my future son-in-law, Miss Jaqueline, I expect
you will turn up your pretty nose and utterly refuse him."
</p>

<p>
"I shall if he has four children belonging to another
woman."
</p>

<p>
Her father raised his brows. The young girl turned
scarlet and clasped her arms about Mrs. Mason's
neck.
</p>

<p>
"Mother dear, forgive that awkward speech. We are
all glad to have you, as you must be aware by this time,
and since you are such a comfort and pleasure to papa it
would be the height of jealous unamiability not to love
you. But if <i>you</i> had left four children you wouldn't want
me for their stepmother, would you, now? Confess the
truth."
</p>

<p>
She looked very arch and pretty, and her voice had a
persuasive cadence that amused her father.
</p>

<p>
"They might fare worse, my dear girl," returned Mrs.
Mason. "I should trust Annis anywhere with you. And
Marian would make a charming mother, but I do think
she is entitled to some young, sweet life of her own. I
cannot help thinking how one extreme begets another.
Your grandparents are very authoritative&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Domineering is better," interposed the squire laughingly.
"You are great for picking out the softer words,
Patty. Mr. Floyd is of the old school, and his beliefs intensify
with age. His children were put in the world to
honor and obey him. Brandon married an heiress with
an estate and no end of slaves. Jane slipped through
with the man of her choice, but you can notice that he is
rather captious about Arthur, who is doing very well and
will be a rich man if he doesn't blunder in the Washington
bogs. I think myself Marian and Dolly are kept
in very narrow bounds. Dolly has a way of slipping out,
but Marian is rather timid."
</p>

<p>
"The system has made her so, but I should think she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_105' name='Page_105'>[105]</a></span>
would have inherited a good deal of spirit and force of
character."
</p>

<p>
"I think I shall turn over a new leaf myself," declared
the squire, with a twinkle of humor in his eye. "In the
future, Miss Jaqueline, I wish you to consult me about
your goings-out and comings-in. You are to say 'Sir'
to me in the most respectful fashion. Perhaps your
mother would like you to address her as 'Madam.' You
are to take no hand in the affairs of foolish young lovers.
You are not to go careering about the plantation on
horseback, but to be sober, discreet, and industrious with
your needle. Perhaps it would be well for you to keep
a journal. Is there anything else? I must consult Aunt
Catharine. Your mother is quite too easy."
</p>

<p>
There was a laugh in every dimple and line in the
young girl's face. Any pretense of austerity sat oddly
enough on the squire's round, humorous countenance.
</p>

<p>
There was a sudden interruption of the three younger
children racing up the patch in a breathless fashion. Annis
went straight to her mother's arms, Charles halted at
his father's side and snatched his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Is Annis my sister truly, papa?"
</p>

<p>
"But it's just the same," interrupted Varina, whose
tone indicated that she had been in a warm discussion.
"And, papa, can he marry her?"
</p>

<p>
"More family difficulties!" declared the squire. "Is
the world going crazy? And, Varina, marriages do not
begin with the babies of the family."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not a baby." Charles straightened himself up to
his tallest. "I said when I was a grown man I should
marry Annis. I am going to study hard and go to
Congress; perhaps I shall be sent abroad on some
mission."
</p>

<p>
"And isn't the husband always the oldest, papa?
Charles is almost two years younger than Annis."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_106' name='Page_106'>[106]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"One year and eight months," corrected Charles. "I
don't see what difference it can make. I shall be the
tallest and earn the money. And she isn't my own sister.
She isn't any real relation. But if she was my cousin I
could marry her."
</p>

<p>
The squire laughed heartily, which rather disconcerted
Varina.
</p>

<p>
"Truly," he said, "love seems to have broken out as a
distemper. And so you want Annis for a sweetheart,
Charles? What does Annis say to all this?"
</p>

<p>
Annis was caressing her mother's hand.
</p>

<p>
"She likes me better than anybody except her mother."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, little Annis, have you thrown me over? And
after the pony, too!"
</p>

<p>
The squire's voice was whimsically upbraiding, and
his glance touched her tender heart. She flew over to
him.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I do love you!" she cried. "But you have
mamma, and I know I can never get back all of her."
</p>

<p>
"Do you want all of her back? Would you take her
away?"
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't have any home to take her to. And she
likes it here and all the children and you, and I like it too
now. I don't mind giving part of her away."
</p>

<p>
"And next she likes me." Charles went around and
stood by her side in his manliest pose. They made a
pretty picture.
</p>

<p>
"I thought you loved <i>me</i> a good deal," interposed
Jaqueline.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I love you all!" said the child, though she
glanced doubtfully at Varina.
</p>

<p>
"But, then, girls don't marry ever, no matter how
much they love each other," said the young admirer.
</p>

<p>
"And she <i>is</i> our sister," persisted Varina.
</p>

<p>
"Not in that sense, my little girl. And the age makes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_107' name='Page_107'>[107]</a></span>
no difference. So she can be Charles' sweetheart until
he goes to college and gets another one."
</p>

<p>
"But I do not mean ever to get another one. And we
were playing keep house under the big hemlock. Dinah
had made us some cookies. And Rene was the company&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I shall not be company any more," returned the
child, with a toss of the head. "If you want Annis, take
her then."
</p>

<p>
"There, children, no quarreling. Aren't the cookies
good enough to be peacemakers?"
</p>

<p>
"But we've eaten them all up."
</p>

<p>
Varina marched off in a huff. Jaqueline was laughing.
Mrs. Mason looked annoyed. The stepfather
kissed Annis tenderly.
</p>

<p>
"There," he said, "run off and finish your play. Be
the best of friends, and have the best times you can. The
world will look different to you a dozen years hence, and
love will settle perplexities."
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline had followed her sister, though she knew
Varina was generally the marplot in their play.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Randolph, how could you!" exclaimed Mrs. Mason,
with a touch of upbraiding. "Such matters are too
grave and serious for children's plays."
</p>

<p>
"Yet I suppose we have all taken a hand in it. When
I was a boy of nine or ten I was very much in love with
a young relative who used to visit us. She taught me to
dance, and I remember I wrote some verses to her. She
must have been at least fifteen, for two years later she
married, and I was so surprised and hurt that I think I
always hated her husband until I was nearly grown and
fell in love again. And after that I met your cousin."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Mason still looked unconvinced.
</p>

<p>
"It won't hurt Charles. I like to see boys chivalrous
and devoted, and Annis is such a darling. It would delight
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_108' name='Page_108'>[108]</a></span>
me if they were old enough to have it all in sober
earnest. There, do not look so grave over a little childish
nonsense. Let us rather be fortifying ourselves for
the avalanche that is to descend on our devoted heads.
One can hardly blame Jaqueline, but I am afraid poor
Marian will have a hard time. Presently <i>we</i> shall begin
to be plagued with lovers."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Mason gave a little sigh. It had been quite a
task at first to induce Annis to be really friendly with the
children; now she and Charles were inseparable. At first
Varina had tormented them with childish jealousy,
though there were not many of their enjoyments she
wanted to share. Boisterous games and frolics were
more to her fancy than books, but Annis could have listened
forever. They were both extravagantly fond of
flowers and rambling about. Mrs. Mason had so many
duties to the household and the slaves, that she was often
relieved when the little girl found amusement elsewhere.
And Charles was an admirable companion, with his even
temper, his heroic romances, his innate love for whatever
was noble and true, his courtesy and kindliness. In the
earlier years Varina had quite tyrannized over him, but
as their tastes began to differ he quietly emancipated
himself with the rare art born in some people. The tutor
had given him a dignity of position. Annis appreciated
this quiet side of his nature, though she enjoyed
the songs and dances and frolics of the pickaninnies, and
often joined in a game of romps.
</p>

<p>
Just now the mother had a half-jealous feeling that
her child should find satisfaction elsewhere. There were
so many years between her and womanhood that it was
foolish to pay heed to the child's play, she knew.
</p>

<p>
From various causes they had not made their usual
weekly visit to the Pineries. Jaqueline half wished Patricia
would insist upon going, but she did not. As for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_109' name='Page_109'>[109]</a></span>
herself, she hardly dared venture, lest some untoward
questions might be asked.
</p>

<p>
And so one day the old-fashioned yellow coach with
driver and footman turned up the avenue. There had
been a recent rain, and the air was cool and fragrant.
Mr. and Mrs. Mason were out on the wide porch at the
northern end. Dinner was over, and the squire had tilted
back his chair where he could lean against the great
square column, and prepared for his siesta.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Mason was sewing. The girls were in the big
swing under some great sycamore trees, and Louis was
lounging on the grass.
</p>

<p>
"Randolph, your mother and Mr. Floyd," said his
wife, startled.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Mason rose, but the footman had helped out Mr.
Floyd, who sat nearest, and Mr. Mason clasped his
mother's hand after she had alighted.
</p>

<p>
"This is a great surprise and pleasure, but the air is
magnificent, just the day for driving. I was over to the
courthouse most of the morning. I've had that bother
of the Chaffee estate on my hands, but we are getting it
into shape. It has taken a good deal of my time."
</p>

<p>
"We had looked for you up," returned his mother,
with a touch of asperity in her tone.
</p>

<p>
"Scipio, see that the horses are put out&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The horses have been attended to. We stopped at
Rhoby's and had a little rest and a bite of something."
</p>

<p>
"But you will have dinner&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No, no!" Mr. Floyd waved his long white hand impressively.
"We have not come to stay, and will drive
back presently."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Mason had come forward and greeted her guests.
But she felt the storm in the air, and caught the perplexity
in her husband's eye.
</p>

<p>
"Shall we go within?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_110' name='Page_110'>[110]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"No; it is so much pleasanter here. There is enough
time in winter to be shut up in rooms. Give me the great
world out of doors, when it is neither too hot nor too
cold."
</p>

<p>
"All are well, I suppose?" asked Mrs. Mason.
</p>

<p>
"Brandon's little son is quite ill&mdash;the second child.
We only heard last evening. Some kind of a fever. I
hope it will not be severe. They are fine boys," declared
their grandmother with pride.
</p>

<p>
"We have escaped wonderfully on the plantation.
Very little sickness so far," Mr. Mason remarked, and
there was an ominous pause.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Mason," began the old gentleman, clearing his
voice, "I had a visitor a few days ago, who, I understood,
had your countenance in a very impertinent matter. I
was amazed that you should for a moment entertain the
thought that anything he might say would be acceptable
to me&mdash;to us," glancing at his wife.
</p>

<p>
Randolph Mason met the issue squarely.
</p>

<p>
"You mean Lieutenant Ralston?"
</p>

<p>
"That ill-bred puppy who, if he wants to do his country
any service, had better go out against the Indians
and protect the border people from their depredations instead
of flirting around after women. I wonder that you
sent him on such a fool's errand. You knew my plans
concerning my daughter Marian?"
</p>

<p>
"I advised him to write to you, but he was very much
in earnest and thought he could plead his cause better."
</p>

<p>
"The fellow is a silly, insufferable idiot! Yes&mdash;I
know," waving his hand authoritatively, "the kind of people
Jane consorts with, and I might have been certain
the society there would do the girls no good. But that
you should not only aid and abet him, but allow your
home to be made the scene of an intrigue, is treating your
mother and myself shamefully, and exposing your young
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_111' name='Page_111'>[111]</a></span>
sister to the machinations of an unprincipled fellow! If
you choose to allow your daughters to consort with such
cattle&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hold, Mr. Floyd! I will not have an honorable young
man accused in that manner, neither will I allow you to
traduce my household. There was no intrigue, but an
accidental meeting here&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Floyd rose in a passion, his eyes sparkling, his face
flushed.
</p>

<p>
"Do you dare to tell me there was no underhand plan
in all this? Jaqueline's adroitly worded note, that might
have aroused suspicion if we had not considered you
above such a scheme. It was atrocious, sir! We had
refused to have her visit her sister on that account. She
had met the young man there. And how was it <i>he</i>
should come at this particular juncture?"
</p>

<p>
"My son brought him down from Washington. He is
in the habit of asking his friends. Another friend was
coming, Mr. Roger Carrington."
</p>

<p>
"Where is Louis? Let me see him. Let him deny
his part of the plan, if he can, with truth."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Floyd, do common justice to the young man.
He is a fine, highly esteemed person, in a good position,
and numbers his friends among the best. His attentions
would be no insult to any woman. That a pretty young
girl should be admired is no uncommon thing; that more
than one man should want to marry her is nothing derogatory.
You may not care to accept him for a son-in-law&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"She should not marry him if she never married at
all!" thundered the irascible old man. "I had other
and better plans for her. Some months ago one of our
most estimable neighbors, a man of large property and
unsullied reputation, asked for her hand. Being a widower,
he would make no advances until the year of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_112' name='Page_112'>[112]</a></span>
mourning had expired, which certainly evinced a delicacy
worthy of all commendation. Marian knew she was as
good as betrothed. Ha! Louis!" as the young man
crossed the porch. "Tell me the truth, sir? Did you
not bring that scheming adventurer down here to meet
Marian?"
</p>

<p>
"I have no idea to whom you refer. I have no such
person on my list of acquaintances," declared Louis
haughtily.
</p>

<p>
"That beggarly lieutenant! Don't tell me he wouldn't
be glad enough to marry a girl with a good dower."
</p>

<p>
"I certainly asked Lieutenant Ralston to come with
Mr. Carrington. I knew the Fairfax girls were to be
here, but Marian was a surprise to me."
</p>

<p>
"You are not telling the truth, young man."
</p>

<p>
"Very well. Believe as you like." Louis turned on
his heel and walked off indignantly.
</p>

<p>
"Father," said Mrs. Floyd reprovingly, "Jaqueline
must have known. It was her letter that made all the
trouble. I dare say Louis was not in the plot."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Floyd was proud of her fine-looking grandson.
He had always been a favorite.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; where is that deceitful girl? I warn you, Randolph
Mason, that you will have trouble with one so headstrong
and lawless."
</p>

<p>
"You forget you are speaking of my daughter."
</p>

<p>
"I don't care whose daughter she is!" the old man
roared in his anger. "I want to tell her that her schemes
have fallen through, that she has only made Marian a
miserable, disobedient girl in encouraging this wicked
fancy when she was on the eve of an engagement with
her parents' approval and sanction."
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline walked across the path and up the steps with
her head held haughtily erect.
</p>

<p>
"I am here to answer for any crime I may have committed,"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_113' name='Page_113'>[113]</a></span>
she said in a clear, cutting tone. "Papa allows
us some liberty in choosing our friends, and certainly as
guests in the house they are under his supervision. The
Fairfaxes were old neighbors. The Carringtons were
old friends of my own mother and her dear cousin. Mr.
Ralston is held in high esteem in Washington. I was
not at all sure Marian would come when I wrote, but I
thought it a good opportunity&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"For that fellow to turn her head with his wretched
nonsense, to make her silly and disobedient and full of
romantic notions. But it will do no good, I tell you!
She has been proposed to in due form by Mr. Greaves,
and you may notify your friend that she is engaged.
And, Miss Jaqueline, I warn you not to write her any
letters upholding your views, which are certainly most
pernicious and shocking for a young girl. Until she is
married you are not to meet again. I call you a dangerous
girl."
</p>

<p>
"That will do," said Randolph Mason, coming and
taking his daughter's hand in his. "I think you quite
forget yourself, Mr. Floyd. If Marian had not cared for
this young man there would not have been any trouble.
Beware how you compel her to marry one man while her
heart is another's!"
</p>

<p>
"My daughter has been trained to habits of obedience
and respect for her parents' opinions," returned the old
gentleman loftily. "You will find that you have made
a great mistake in the rearing of yours. But, on the other
hand, they have been bereft of a mother's wisdom and
care, such as <i>your</i> mother has given to mine," and he
bowed in a courtly fashion to Mrs. Floyd. "I am afraid
that you, madam," turning to Mrs. Mason, "will find
your way a thorny one indeed, if you have any regard for
the probity and welfare of these children you have undertaken
to train."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_114' name='Page_114'>[114]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"We will not go into a discussion of methods," returned
Mr. Mason with a sort of dry austerity. "I am
sorry that Marian's meeting Lieutenant Ralston here
should have led to such an unpleasant culmination.
Young people of to-day do have more liberty than the
older generation, yet I should have taken it very hard if
Jaqueline Verney's father had compelled her to marry a
man she did not like when she loved me. So we cannot
blame the young man for trying&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"That was a suitable, sensible match," interrupted Mr.
Floyd. "This is a foolish, sentimental affair. And I
have to say if it receives any more encouragement from
this house, it will make a lasting breach. If Marian
should dare to leave her home and throw herself on this
fellow's protection we should cast her out altogether, and
she would be no daughter of ours."
</p>

<p>
"Father, father!" entreated Mrs. Floyd, placing her
hand upon his arm.
</p>

<p>
"I mean it. This is my warning. I will not be interfered
with."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Mason had been standing beside his wife's chair.
Now he advanced toward his stepfather.
</p>

<p>
"I have made my apology. I am sorry such a thing
should have happened here, though I cannot find it in my
heart to blame the young people. And now let us heal
the difference. Have a glass of wine and some refreshments."
</p>

<p>
"We must return at once. It is a long ride. But I
wanted you to know what your daughter's meddling had
led to, and my unalterable determination. Come, Elizabeth,"
holding out his hand to his wife. "We shall be
glad to see you and Mrs. Patricia, but for the present I
insist there shall be no communication with the young
people."
</p>

<p>
He glared at the group and turned away. Mr. Mason
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_115' name='Page_115'>[115]</a></span>
offered no further entreaty, but went around to his mother's
side.
</p>

<p>
"Twice you have married the man of your choice," he
said in a low tone. "I suppose you have been very
happy. Try and deal gently with Marian and persuade
rather than force."
</p>

<p>
"You will understand when your girls want to make
unsuitable and willful marriages. You had better look
sharply after Jaqueline. When Marian is left alone she
will soon recover her tranquil frame of mind. Jane is
interdicted as well. Jane has grown very frivolous since
she has had so much Washington society. And Mrs.
Madison is extremely worldly and vain, and not to be
compared with Mrs. Adams or Mrs. Washington."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Mason rose and bade her guests a formal adieu.
Mr. Mason walked down the broad steps and saw them
seated in the coach. When it had turned into the winding
part of the avenue Jaqueline made a rush and flung
her arms around her father's neck.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, papa, dear!&mdash;I never supposed it would make
any trouble. And I wasn't sure Mr. Ralston would come,
or Marian either, for that matter, and I never said a word
to Marian. Jane is so much interested in the matter, and
both she and Mr. Jettson like Mr. Ralston so very much.
But grandpapa grows more and more arbitrary&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Of course he was very much vexed. I am afraid I
am a foolish fellow and let you children run over me.
You don't even seem to stand in awe of your stepmother.
I shall have to get my backbone stiffened by some
process."

</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">THE WEAKER VESSEL.</span>
</h2>

<p>
They came up the steps with their arms about each
other. Mrs. Mason stood there, Annis clinging to
her skirt, Patricia and Varina looking on in curious expectancy.
Louis ventured out of his retreat.
</p>

<p>
"We don't want papa changed any, do we?" placing
her other arm over her mother's shoulder, and glancing
fondly into her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't live with grandpapa for all the world!"
began Patricia.
</p>

<p>
"There, children!" exclaimed their father; "we will
not discuss the matter. Mr. Floyd feels sure he is right,
and I am very sorry it should have happened, though I
can't see that any of you were out of the way&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I knew Ralston cared a great deal for Marian," said
Louis, "and I never imagined that old Mr. Greaves
would stand in the way. Do you suppose he would
if he knew it? And I admire Ralston bearding the
lion in his den. It's a shame that poor Polly should
have to suffer, but I hope she will be spunky and not
give in."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean to make us marry whoever you like?"
Patty edged up to her father and raised a saucy face with
laughing eyes.
</p>

<p>
"You will find me terrible when you reach that
period," declared their father. "At present there are
enough things for you to consider and learn about without
taking up marriage."
</p>

<p>
"Do you suppose grandpapa is in real earnest? He
looked very resolute, didn't he? I've seen him angry
with the slaves, and I shouldn't like to belong to him,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_117' name='Page_117'>[117]</a></span>
I really shouldn't. And do you think he actually doesn't
want any of us to come up&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Not at present. I trust the matter will blow over.
Marian will give in after a while and, no doubt, be very
comfortable. Ask your mother if she is sorry. I know
little Annis wants to go back to Kentucky," and he
pinched the child's cheek.
</p>

<p>
"You'll have to go alone," declared Louis.
</p>

<p>
"But I can't go alone; I should get lost. And I don't
want to go away from you all."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Mason flushed and smiled at the raillery.
</p>

<p>
"But, you see, we are old enough to appreciate
mamma," began Jaqueline. "And those Greaves children
are all little, and they are very plain too. One of the
boys has a squint eye. It looks so queer, as if he always
saw two ways. And poor Marian will have to settle to
playing whist, and she does love so to dance. She had
such a good time here, and in Washington with Jane."
</p>

<p>
Dixon, the overseer, came up the path. Mr. Mason
was wanted to settle some matter. Patty and Jaqueline
sat down on the step by their mother and Annis leaned
against her knee, while Varina hung over Patty's shoulder,
rather to her sister's discomfort. And, in spite of
their father's request, they went on talking of Marian.
Their mother said they were too young to know what was
really best in such matters; but they thought they did,
and she could not lead them to other subjects. They
were very happy, and not difficult to get along with, if
they were rather lawless. To be sure, Jaqueline did
evince a tendency to admiration, and often gave dangerous
glances out of eyes that could look languishing
as well as laughing.
</p>

<p>
Louis did not hesitate to express his indignation to
both of his sisters.
</p>

<p>
"Grandpapa is an old tyrant!" he declared; "and I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_118' name='Page_118'>[118]</a></span>
dare say we'll never hear. It's like someone taking off
your book when you are at the most interesting part."
</p>

<p>
"Do you suppose we'll be asked to the wedding?"
wondered Patty; "and what a farce congratulations
would be? 'I hope you will be very happy.' 'I wish
you much joy.'"
</p>

<p>
Patty pirouetted round, shaking an imaginary hand
and using a most affected tone, at which they all laughed.
</p>

<p>
But Marian surprised them all with a letter, written
the day her parents were away. How she sent it was a
mystery. It excited them all beyond measure.
</p>

<p>
"It was dreadful," she wrote. "Oh, Jaqueline! if I
could have known Lieutenant Ralston was there I should
have rushed into the room and told him that I loved him,
and that I should never, never marry anyone else, if
father shut me up in a dungeon and kept me on bread and
water! But I did not know until he was sent away, and
I can't know all that father said to him, but I do know he
was very fierce and unreasonable. And I was so frightened
when father went at me that I had to confess about
those two delicious days. He was sure it was a plot on
your part, and he taxed me with having known all about
it. I didn't dream of such a thing at first, but I am
afraid it was so.
</p>

<p>
"I never saw anyone so angry. At first I was dreadfully
frightened. But when he accused me of duplicity
and forwardness, and said I had run after Mr. Ralston, it
roused me, and I said I loved him and I never would
marry anyone else. I know he would wait years for me.
And when Mr. Greaves asks me I shall tell him plain out
how I feel about it, and I am quite sure he will not want
to marry me. I hate the prosy old fellow! I wish Mr.
Ralston could know how much I care for him. I expect
you are having a terrible time to-day with father. Oh,
I wish he could be like brother Randolph! Oh, Jaqueline,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_119' name='Page_119'>[119]</a></span>
do you know how delightful it is! And your mother
is so sweet, just like another girl. Such old people as
father and mother forget they ever were young."
</p>

<p>
There was much more youthful and romantic protest
and resolve.
</p>

<p>
"I really didn't think Marian had so much force of
character," said Louis. "I do wonder if it would be
wrong to give Ralston an inkling of how the case stands?
It seems as if she almost expected us to do it."
</p>

<p>
"I think papa ought to see the letter," returned Jaqueline
soberly. "And I almost know he will not want us
to stir further in the matter. Marian must have someone
she can trust, or she would not have dared to write the
letter. Oh, I hope she will be true and brave, and some
time it may come out right!"
</p>

<p>
"Mis' Jettson's come," said Julia. "And your pa and
ma have gone over to Middle Creek."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Jane!" They all made a rush to the great
front piazza, Jaqueline with her letter in hand.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, girls!" cried Jane, "did you have a dreadful time
when father was down here? He wrote me a letter. But
Lieutenant Ralston had been in, and he told me of his call
at the Pineries. You see, he thought they were as good
as engaged; only he meant to begin honorably, and ask
father's sanction to his addresses. But father was&mdash;yes,
really outrageous&mdash;if he is my father! I've always felt
he would be a gentleman under any circumstances, but
this was insulting, abusive; and Lieutenant Ralston is well
bred and well connected, and is in the way of getting a fine
position. And, in any event, there was nothing derogatory
to Marian in his falling in love with her. Why, he is
invited almost everywhere, and the girls are pulling straws
for him. Then father writes me a very cross and irritating
note, and says for the present Marian is to hold no
communication with me&mdash;my own sister, too!&mdash;and that I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_120' name='Page_120'>[120]</a></span>
am not to mention nor in any way refer to Mr. Ralston,
but that any letter of mine will be read by him first. Why,
we might as well go back to the Dark Ages, or be Puritans
at once! I believe those old Puritan fathers compelled
their daughters to marry to their liking. If I
<i>could</i> only know how Marian feels! Why do you all look
so queer? Jaqueline, who is your letter from?"
</p>

<p>
"From Marian," said the girl, with rising color.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I <i>must</i> see it." She took it from Jaqueline's
hand. "Oh, poor, dear Marian! If she loves him it
will be all right. And she does. I think father won't
have such an easy time persuading her to marry Mr.
Greaves. Why, he could have been her father; he's old
enough! And none of us can write to her. It is too
cruel! Now tell me what was said the day they were
down here."
</p>

<p>
The scene lost nothing by repetition. They all agreed
about the injustice. Then Jane decided she would return
at once. The baby was teething and rather fretful. They
were to go to Bladensburg for a fortnight.
</p>

<p>
"And, Jaqueline, I wish you could come. It is really
quite gay there, and the water is said to be so good.
Arthur is too busy to leave, and often has to spend his
evenings drafting and making plans. Patty might come
too, if she liked."
</p>

<p>
So the word of encouragement went its way to the
lover, and was a great comfort and delight.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you will all respect grandfather's wishes," said
Mr. Mason, when he read his young sister's letter. "I
shall trust you not to hold any communication with
Marian."
</p>

<p>
"But if Jane does?" commented Louis.
</p>

<p>
"That is not strictly our affair. And, Louis, do not be
too ready to give young Ralston the encouragement of
this letter, even. Mr. Floyd is very tenacious and&mdash;"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_121' name='Page_121'>[121]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you might as well call it obstinate," laughed
Louis. "Perhaps Marian may inherit some of the same
characteristics, when it comes to the point. And I fancy
we are all on her side. It is as you once said, Jack, we <i>do</i>
have to take sides!"
</p>

<p>
"And I'm going to be on Marian's side," said Varina
proudly. "I don't like grandpapa very much. Annis,
what will you do?"
</p>

<p>
"I like Marian," she replied a little timidly.
</p>

<p>
"Now we must go and see what side Charles will take.
The old knights fought for the ladies."
</p>

<p>
"I see you are all arrayed in rebellion," and the squire
shook his head. "I am afraid I have not brought you up
properly."
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline and Patty went to Bladensburg, which was
quite a resort. Louis joined a party who were going
down the Chesapeake in a sailing vessel, and the three
young ones played and disputed and made up friends.
The elders essayed several duty visits to the Pineries, but
they saw the girls only in the presence of their parents,
so Marian had no opportunity of explaining how matters
were going with her; but she was thinner and heavy-eyed,
and had lost her spirits. Mr. and Mrs. Floyd held their
heads high and were rather captious.
</p>

<p>
What had happened when Mr. Greaves' year of mourning
had expired was that he went over to the Pineries
one afternoon dressed in a new suit and gotten up quite
in the style of the day. After Marian entered the room
he made a formal proposal for her hand and asked her
father's consent.
</p>

<p>
"You have mine, most cordially," said Mr. Floyd in
his grandest manner. "It is my wish that my daughter
should accept you as her future husband. It is natural
and womanly that she should have some misgivings on
the subject, as it is a grave one and full of responsibility.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_122' name='Page_122'>[122]</a></span>
But we have reared her to do her duty in that state of life
to which it shall please God to call her. And her mother
and I hope to see her fill this place in your home and your
affections, and become a happy wife at the proper time.
We are in no hurry to part with her, but until that time
you will be a most welcome guest."
</p>

<p>
Marian shivered, but her tongue clung to the roof of her
mouth when she would have spoken. It seemed to her as
if she should scream if he touched her hand, but he contented
himself with making a rather elaborate speech to
her mother, and pressing the elder's hand to his lips.
There was some wine and cake brought in, and healths
were drunk. After some desultory conversation supper
was announced, a very high tea befitting a festive occasion.
There was the inevitable game of whist afterward.
This was Thursday, and Sunday Mr. Greaves walked
over to the Floyds' pew, and down the aisle with Miss
Marian, Mrs. Floyd having taken Dolly under her wing.
And the matter seemed to be settled without any voice
from Marian either way.
</p>

<p>
"But it is dreadful! I never, never will marry him!"
sobbed the girl on Dolly's neck in the quiet of their own
chamber. "If I <i>could</i> run away! And if I only knew
about Mr. Ralston!"
</p>

<p>
"If we could only hear from Jane! You will have to
let things go on and hope for some way out of it. I wonder
who will come along for me? And we might be having
such a delightful time with Jane! I sometimes wish
Mr. Ralston had not come to hand and spoiled it all."
</p>

<p>
"But you can't think, Dolly, how deliciously sweet
those two days were! A whole lifetime of that!" sighingly.
</p>

<p>
"But men only love that way a little while. Then it
gets to be an old story and is merely respect," returned
the wise younger sister.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_123' name='Page_123'>[123]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I am sure Arthur is fond of Jane and proud enough
of her too, and look at brother Randolph! Oh, I just
envy Jaqueline! What a nice time she will have!"
</p>

<p>
Dolly had said so many times, "It's just awful,
Marian," that she had nothing more left to say. Then, it
was hard to be watched and questioned and not allowed
any liberty on Marian's account. She didn't see how
Marian could run away, for she was never trusted to go
anywhere alone. And no well-bred girl would throw herself
at her lover without a very urgent invitation.
</p>

<p>
The clergyman and his wife came in to tea, and found
Mr. Greaves there, and congratulated them both. Then
the neighbors took it up as a settled thing, and poor
Marian felt the net closing about her. There had been
a vague half-expectation that Lieutenant Ralston would
make some effort to assure her of his constancy. Or
if some word could come from Jane!
</p>

<p>
Louis went back to Williamsburg, and Patricia was
sent for some educational advantages. There was a new
little girl at the Jettsons', and Jaqueline was to be one
of the godmothers. Afterward Jane pleaded so hard for
her to remain. She could go on with her French and her
singing, as she had a very pretty voice and singing was
one of the accomplishments of the day. Then, too, the
Carringtons were very glad to have her. Indeed, Jaqueline
was a great favorite for her vivacity and her charming
manner, which was so pretty and deferential to her
elders, so bright and winsome to her compeers.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Mason took up the education of the two little
girls with Charles' help. He went over to the house of the
clergyman every morning, who was a graduate of Oxford
and quite ready to piece out his salary with a class of five
small boys in the neighborhood. Charles was a born
student, delighted with all kinds of knowledge. Annis
was always interested as well.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_124' name='Page_124'>[124]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"You will make the child a regular bookworm," declared
the squire. And then he would take her and
Varina off for a canter over the hills.
</p>

<p>
"I don't see why girls and women shouldn't love to
learn," Charles said to his mother.
</p>

<p>
"But they can't be doctors, nor ministers, nor judges,
nor politicians," smilingly.
</p>

<p>
"They could help their husbands if they knew
how."
</p>

<p>
"But they help them by keeping the house in good
order, and watching the servants, and sewing, and making
their husbands comfortable and happy."
</p>

<p>
"I want Annis to learn a great many other things,
for you know I am to marry her when we are grown up,"
said the little boy gravely.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Mason smiled at his earnestness.
</p>

<p>
A messenger had been sent down from the Pineries
early in December to invite all the family to a Christmas
dinner. Mrs. Floyd had not been in her usual health for
some weeks back, and now that the cause of disagreement
had been removed she was anxious to receive all the
family that could come together. She had hoped to
have Mr. and Mrs. Conway, but he could not leave his
parish at such an important time. So, if they would
waive their own family gathering and join her she would
be most grateful. She realized that she and Mr. Floyd
were getting to be old people, and they could not tell how
much longer they might be spared.
</p>

<p>
"Then it is all settled that Marian will marry Mr.
Greaves," said Mr. Mason.
</p>

<p>
His wife gave a little sigh.
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline came home to hear the verdict and vent her
indignation. Jane had received a letter from her father
announcing that Marian had accepted the husband selected
for her and given up her rebellious attitude. So the family,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_125' name='Page_125'>[125]</a></span>
he hoped, would meet in amity once more. Mrs.
Floyd had not been well of late, and was desirous of seeing
her new little granddaughter.
</p>

<p>
"Marian can't have given up so easily! And all this
time Mr. Ralston has been so confident! What an awful
disappointment it will be to him! He has gone up to Philadelphia
to consult with some engineers. Oh, papa, can't
something be done? Jane is almost wild about it."
</p>

<p>
"My dear girl, if Marian is satisfied&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But I cannot think she is. She did love Mr. Ralston
so!"
</p>

<p>
"A girl's fancy. How many lovers have you had?
See how indulgent I am to trust you to Jane, who really
hasn't much more sense than you."
</p>

<p>
"Why, I haven't any real lover. And I do not want
one for ever so long." Yet she flushed and dropped her
eyes.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps he would not have trusted his daughter in the
giddy whirl of society if he had not known of someone
every way worthy and acceptable, who was watching her
and waiting for the right moment to speak. When she
had taken her fling of gayety, she would be the more
ready to listen. And he would not mar what he really
desired by seeming to bias her inclinations. She was not
a girl to be forced into a step or have her patience worn
out, as he suspected was the case with his young sister
Marian.
</p>

<p>
"Of course Jane means to join the family party?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes. Jane has been almost heartbroken over the
matter. She is very fond of Marian and Dolly. Oh,
papa, I hope you won't get cross and queer as you grow
older!"
</p>

<p>
He laughed and patted her shoulder. "Grandfather
thinks you will all come to grief from over-indulgence."
</p>

<p>
"We are all going to come out magnificently in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_126' name='Page_126'>[126]</a></span>
end, just to prove him a false prophet and you the very
dearest of fathers."
</p>

<p>
"You are a sad flatterer, Jack. I'm afraid you learn too
much of it in the gay circles. But you must be on your
best behavior at the Pineries, and not stir up any disaffection.
Family differences are very disagreeable things;
and, after all, age is entitled to a certain indulgence and
respect. I shouldn't wonder if you were a queer, arbitrary
old lady yourself."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, papa!" reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
Patricia thought it very hard that she could not come
home for Christmas, which was the great holiday of all
the year. But Louis was not coming; he had some arrears
to make up, and was also very much interested in
one of a certain household of girls, and was to attend their
Christmas-Eve ball. Patty grumbled a good deal.
Aunt Catharine treated her like one of the children. She
was not allowed to go to parties, and she had to learn all
kinds of fancywork and cooking, and making sauces and
everything. "And I've made up my mind if keeping a
house is so much work I shall never get married," declared
the much-tried girl. "And I think aunt was
much nicer as an old maid than a married woman.
Though she's a great personage now, and everybody
comes to her for advice and patterns and stitches in lace-making
and recipes for everything. If I ever did marry,
I wouldn't be a clergyman's wife."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Conway wrote a rather stilted, but very affectionate,
letter to her mother and Marian. She congratulated
the latter warmly. Gray Court was certainly a fine old
place. Four children were a great responsibility; she
found her three a continual care, but Mr. Conway was so
devoted to his study, his classes, and his sermons she
could have no help from him. As they wanted certainly
to come to the marriage in the spring, it was better to wait
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_127' name='Page_127'>[127]</a></span>
until then, as it was quite impossible to get away now.
She sent Marian a piece of fine old lace that she had
bought from a parishioner in very reduced circumstances,
and who was the last of her line.
</p>

<p>
The Pineries wore a welcome aspect for the guests.
Great fires were kept blazing in the wide chimneys, and
the Franklin stove in the hall sent out pleasant cheer.
Brandon the son, his wife, and three children were among
the first guests. The Masons added six, and Mrs. Jettson
came with her three babies, but her husband was not
to join them until Christmas morning, on account of some
engagements.
</p>

<p>
There was staying at the house a young Mr. Floyd, a
distant relative from South Carolina. It was plain to be
seen that he was very sweet on Dolly, and grandfather
was highly elated.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Greaves had certainly thawed a little. He was
quite lover-like in a courtly and formal fashion, and made
himself very much a son of the house. In arranging for
the guests Mrs. Floyd had brought her two daughters
next to her own room so there should be no chance for
nightly gossips or confidences over dressing. Marian
had begun to think a home of her own desirable. With
the unreason of womankind she felt that Mr. Ralston
ought to make some effort to learn her true sentiments.
As he had not, as also her mother persisted that young society
men of that class thought it entertainment to make
love to every woman they met, she had yielded reluctantly.
</p>

<p>
Then, too, Gray Court was a fine old place. It had not
suffered much during the Revolution, though the treasures
of plate and fine china had been buried out of harm's way.
Marian found that she was the envy of the elder spinsters,
and even the younger girls thought her lucky. So she
had given in on condition that the marriage should not
take place until May.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_128' name='Page_128'>[128]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Honey, dat's an awful onlucky month!" said her old
nurse.
</p>

<p>
"Then it shall be June," returned the prospective bride.
</p>

<p>
"And suppose I should be married at the same time!
This is Preston Floyd's second visit, and he and father
hit off wonderfully well. They agree in politics, and I
wonder why it is such a pleasure to have the country go
to ruin. However, I don't think it will; it has stood many
storms. And Charleston must be an agreeable city to live
in, if all be true that is said about it. I would like Philadelphia
or New York, but I see no prospect of getting
there. So if Preston asks me to marry him I shall accept.
I don't suppose father would ever trust us to visit Jane
again. And when you are gone it will be dismal. Marriage
seems the right and proper thing. I wonder if
Jaqueline has a lover!"
</p>

<p>
A modern girl would have complained that Jaqueline
made "big eyes" at Preston Floyd. Before she had been
an hour in the house there was a different atmosphere.
She was not aggressive, and her rather hoydenish ways
were toned down to a certain fearless elegance. She was
bright and vivacious and had bits of merry wit at her
tongue's end, yet it was not so much what she said as her
manner of saying it.
</p>

<p>
"I can't get a word alone with Marian," complained
Jane to the young girl. "But I must say that Mr.
Greaves acquitted himself wonderfully well last evening.
Only Mr. Ralston is so sure Marian will be faithful
through everything. He gave me so many messages
for her, and mother makes a great point of not mentioning
his name. What shall I do?"
</p>

<p>
"It's horrid! I do believe Marian has ceased to care
for him. And now that everything is settled it would
seem dreadful to stir it all up again. Papa insisted that
I should let the matter entirely alone."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_129' name='Page_129'>[129]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"But Mr. Ralston will be so dreadfully disappointed.
He was so proud of his new position for her sake. And
Marian really puzzles me. She <i>seems</i> content. Oh, did
you see that exquisite lace Aunt Catharine sent her? Of
course it <i>is</i> all settled, and if Marian is satisfied&mdash;oh,
Jaqueline, I hope you will really fall in love! I adore
lovers, even if I am the mother of three children. I mean
that my little girl shall have a delightful time when she
is grown up."
</p>

<p>
The children were having a gay time. Varina was
the leader, and Annis, with her soft ways, the peacemaker,
when anything went wrong. The two Jettson
boys adored her. Charles roamed over the old house, and
pleased grandfather by his interest in family legends and
the history of various articles of furniture and plate. It
was grandfather's boast that there wasn't a stick of Yankee
furniture in the house. Charles longed to have Annis
with him, but though grandfather said "she was a nice
little thing," he did not take very fervently to little girls,
and had more than once regretted that Jane and Marian
had not been boys.
</p>

<p>
"I don't see what you find interesting about those
babies," Charles said rather disdainfully. "They're
always wanting to tumble over you and make a
noise, and they're never as funny as the little slave
children, who <i>can</i> amuse you if you want that sort
of fun. I wish you'd come and hear grandfather
talk about the Indians and when the settlers first
came to Virginia."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think he quite likes me," Annis said hesitatingly,
with a nervous little laugh.
</p>

<p>
"As well as he likes any child girls. I think he likes
them better when they are big enough to play whist. But
you could listen, all the same."
</p>

<p>
"I get tired of just listening. I like the children because
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_130' name='Page_130'>[130]</a></span>
they are alive and can laugh and talk. The other
people who have been dead so long&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But you liked Captain John Smith, and the Froissart
men who were so brave. And King Arthur&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But Grandfather Floyd said there never was any
such King Arthur, nor Merlin, nor ever so many other
people."
</p>

<p>
"Grandfather is wrong about some things. And it
isn't polite to contradict him, because he is an old man.
Oh, do come!"
</p>

<p>
"Annis! Annis!" called two or three eager baby voices.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, I would rather be with them. And when we
get home you may tell me all these things. They'll sound
so much better than in grandpapa's voice. It sometimes
gets shaky and seems cold, while yours is soft and sweet
and fine when you come to the grand places."
</p>

<p>
That mollified the boy, who certainly had become
grandfather's favorite, and was pronounced sensible.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">A CHRISTMAS AUGURY.</span>
</h2>

<p>
The slaves at the Pineries were kept with a rather
strict hand. Very few were sold off the plantation,
and then for the gravest misconduct, when whipping
had ceased to be efficacious. But they had increased
largely, and were often hired out, those for the year at
Christmas or the beginning of the year. Christmas Eve
there was a general gathering, and they were allowed a
sort of ball in the great kitchen, where most of the rough
work was done. There were music and song singing,
charms were tried, and they ended with dancing. All the
autumn it was looked forward to eagerly.
</p>

<p>
The supper in the main house was early, and the smaller
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_131' name='Page_131'>[131]</a></span>
children were put to bed. The three Masons and young
Archibald Floyd, who had his grandfather's name, were to
be allowed at the "grand occasion." There were a number
of guests, and seats around the outside were prepared
for them.
</p>

<p>
"And we used to open the dancing," said Jane. "How
proud they were about young missy! And we tried some
of the charms. Looking for your future husband in a pail
of water with a mirror at the bottom. And jumping over
the candles&mdash;do you remember that, Polly? What fun
we used to have with the girls! Why, it is three or four
years since I have been here at Christmastide."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, will they jump over the candles?" cried Jaqueline.
"They did it at the Fairfaxes' last year, and Betty
put the very first one out."
</p>

<p>
"Why, Betty must be two and twenty," said Jane. "It
would be queer if the sign came true."
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't really," laughed Jaqueline. "It is like
tipping your chair over and tumbling up stairs."
</p>

<p>
"I want to try it," declared Dolly. "If you go over
the whole seven you are going to be married soon.
The others count for years. And if you put the first one
out you will surely be an old maid."
</p>

<p>
Some of the songs were very pretty, some ridiculously
funny, several embellished by pantomime. Then the
charms began. The first few were rather simple, and
caused an immense amount of giggling among the young
Phillises. The shadow faces were pursued with a certain
awe, as if they really were something uncanny.
</p>

<p>
Dolly, Jaqueline, and a young lady guest were the only
ones of the "quality" who cared to look.
</p>

<p>
"It is as much your own shadow as anything," declared
Jaqueline, "and it quivers so that you can hardly make it
out."
</p>

<p>
The candles were lighted and placed in a row at even
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_132' name='Page_132'>[132]</a></span>
distances. The young lads tried them first. There were
no skirts in the way, and they went over them
triumphantly.
</p>

<p>
"But men can get mah'ied when they like," said Rose,
Marian's pretty young maid, in her soft half-lisping tone,
"but girls can't always."
</p>

<p>
"Try, Rose!" exclaimed Jaqueline.
</p>

<p>
"I doan know anyone I want. An' I'm promised to go
over to Gray Court with Miss Mayan."
</p>

<p>
"You'll find someone there, perhaps."
</p>

<p>
Bathsheba, tall and supple, with the figure of a Greek
sculpture, went over the seven triumphantly. Sam caught
her by the hand, and a shout went up, echoing in a laughing
chorus.
</p>

<p>
Others tried it with varying luck, evident mortification,
and disappointment. There were some who had been
practicing in secret the whole week, and were well prepared.
</p>

<p>
"Now I am going to try," said Dolly; and there was a
general applauding among the slaves. The space was
made a little larger, though eyes were eager and necks
were craned; and broad smiles illuminated black and
brown faces.
</p>

<p>
"Way for Miss Dolly now. She goin' ober de whole
row. Whoop, now!" and Jep gave his knee a resounding
slap.
</p>

<p>
Dolly gathered up her skirts. The first jump was a
success, the candle only flaring a little. The second&mdash;then
some clapping began. The third dainty leap brought more
applause, then on and on until she had cleared the mystical
number. Shouts and laughter almost shook the roof.
</p>

<p>
"I knew you could do it, Miss Dolly," said Rose, in exultation.
"And Miss Mayan can, too."
</p>

<p>
"Now you will see my luck," and Jaqueline stepped
out on the floor.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_133' name='Page_133'>[133]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"One&mdash;two." Out went the third candle, but Jaqueline
kept on and put out the fourth. She had half a mind to
be angry.
</p>

<p>
"Well, two years isn't long to wait," remarked Dolly
consolingly.
</p>

<p>
"It isn't the waiting. I don't see how I could have
been so stupid, for I can jump almost anything."
</p>

<p>
Miss Marshall was a little timid, but went through the
ordeal successfully, amid bravos.
</p>

<p>
"Marian, try your luck," said Dolly, as Preston Floyd
squeezed her hand so hard it brought a flush to her cheek.
"Ought she not, Cousin Preston? She's the only remaining
single girl here."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, she must," insisted Jaqueline. "You'll all have
time to get good and ready for my wedding."
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline had recovered her spirits, and caught Marian's
arm, laughing gayly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes. Why it's rare fun! Come, Marian. Then I'll
try. I shall go the whole seven," declared Preston.
</p>

<p>
Marian hung back, but they all persisted. If Mr.
Greaves had been there, or her mother, but the
elders had settled to whist, there being enough for two
tables. Some sudden spirit roused her. She had done
it times before. She would be young and gay just for
five minutes.
</p>

<p>
"Come." Preston was leading her out, to Jane's utter
surprise. Marian had been so dignified for the last twenty-four
hours; ten years older, it seemed, than last winter.
And how girlish then!
</p>

<p>
"Marian!"
</p>

<p>
Preston laughed. "Now, Cousin Marian. The whole
seven, for the honor of the house of Floyd."
</p>

<p>
There were two graceful, successful leaps. Her hand
trembled, half a yard of skirt dropped, and out went the
third candle. There was a general cry of disappointment.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_134' name='Page_134'>[134]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"That was an accident," declared Preston. "Light the
candle. Marian, you shall have another chance."
</p>

<p>
"No, no, no!" She caught Jane's arm. "It was very
silly," but her voice had a strained, broken sound, and she
looked frightened.
</p>

<p>
"Take your turn, Cousin Preston, then let them go to
dancing. The fiddlers are tuning up."
</p>

<p>
Jane drew her sister a little aside, while Preston Floyd
won the acclaim of the crowd.
</p>

<p>
"Are you happy and satisfied, Marian, or miserable?"
she asked in a rapid tone, just under her breath. "You
are so queer and changed."
</p>

<p>
"Don't," Marian entreated. "Of course I shall marry
Mr. Greaves. That was girlish foolishness, you know.
And the candles really didn't mean anything. Jaqueline,"
as the girl had come up to her, "we were both in the same
boat for awkwardness. I think I must be growing old,
but you did not have so good an excuse. Do you want to
stay for the dancing? Had we not better all return to
the drawing room?"
</p>

<p>
The younger group demurred.
</p>

<p>
"Then Jane will stay and play propriety."
</p>

<p>
Marian turned swiftly, and was gone before Jane could
utter a word. But she paused in the hall and leaned up
against the door jamb that was almost like a column. Her
breath came quick and hard.
</p>

<p>
"It is too late," she said breathlessly, to herself. "And
he doesn't care. I have passed my word, and to break it
would call down a judgment upon myself. Then&mdash;I
couldn't," and she shuddered. "I am not daring like
Jaqueline, or even Dolly. But Dolly thinks it best."
</p>

<p>
When she entered the room her mother glanced up
with sharp inquiry that softened as she motioned her to
her side.
</p>

<p>
"Did you get tired of the nonsense?" she asked, in an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_135' name='Page_135'>[135]</a></span>
approving tone. "My hand is most played out, and you
shall take my place."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Greaves sat over opposite. He raised his serious,
self-complacent face. She could recall another,&mdash;eager,
warm with rushing emotions,&mdash;and it stood back of this
one like a shadow. But, somehow, it did not beckon her.
She was only a commonplace girl, rather straitly and
strictly reared, with obedience impressed upon her from
babyhood. Her father and mother always kept their
promises, and she must do the same.
</p>

<p>
The fun was fast and furious out in the great kitchen.
But at ten the mistress appeared and made them a little
speech. They were to go to their cabins in an orderly
manner, and any disturbance would be reported. To-morrow
morning they would come for their gifts, and
the week would be one of holidays.
</p>

<p>
"T'ankee, missus; t'ankee, missus!" came from voices
still full of jollity; and woolly heads bobbed in a tumultuous
manner.
</p>

<p>
Christmas Day was made festive by a grand dinner, to
which all the gentry round were invited. The children
had theirs in a smaller room, with quite ornate serving,
and afterward there were games until dark, when the
visitors were sent home in the different carriages. Everybody
was tired from the festivities, and the day had certainly
been a success.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose the lieutenant is quite crowded out of it
all?" inquired Mr. Jettson of his wife. "Really, Mr.
Greaves isn't so bad. But Ralston will take it mightily
hard. He'd wait seven years for a woman. And
Marian seems, somehow, years older, and is beginning to
have some of your mother's dignity."
</p>

<p>
"It is all settled, certainly. As a topic it is interdicted,
and one doesn't get a chance at Marian. Mother and
father are elated, only that isn't quite the word to apply
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_136' name='Page_136'>[136]</a></span>
to them. And there is the Floyd cousin, very much smitten
with Dolly, and I suppose that will be a match. I
feel as if I had lost both of the girls. I had planned to
do so much for Marian, and keep her near to me."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Jettson sighed plaintively.
</p>

<p>
"You poor girl! Then you will have to comfort yourself
with Jaqueline."
</p>

<p>
"It's queer," continued Jane retrospectively, "but Randolph's
family seem nearer to me since they are growing
up than my own sisters and brother. Brandon is so bitter
against the administration, and such a tremendous
aristocrat, while Randolph is always jolly and good-humored,
if he can't quite approve of what is done. And
Jaqueline is so diverting and attractive, while Mrs. Patricia
is charming. If Dolly should go away&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Preston Floyd is an agreeable young fellow. Of
course the family is all right, and the money, I suppose.
Your father will look out for that."
</p>

<p>
"I know Marian isn't happy&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It's a sad piece of business, but it is too late to move
in it now."
</p>

<p>
Jane felt this was true. Could her father have made
<i>her</i> give up her lover? Certainly he was not as arbitrary
then. Or was it her salvation that no rich lover came to
hand?
</p>

<p>
There was another day of festivity, and a dinner to
some who could not come on Christmas Day. Miss
Greaves was present with the two elder children, who
were stiff and proper. She did not altogether approve of
the young wife, when there were more suitable women
ready to take her brother.
</p>

<p>
The Masons gathered up their flock and drove home
immediately afterward, Mr. Jettson going with them, and
the others were to follow the next day.
</p>

<p>
"There wasn't much fun at grandpapa's, except on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_137' name='Page_137'>[137]</a></span>
Christmas Eve," declared Varina. "Archie Floyd thinks
he owns the whole world. If grandpapa should die they
will come there to live, and Uncle Brandon own the
slaves and everything."
</p>

<p>
"Children must not discuss such matters," said her
father rather peremptorily.
</p>

<p>
"But Archie said&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No matter about Archie."
</p>

<p>
Varina frowned and twitched her shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Papa," said Charles after a pause, "shall you leave
the plantation and everything to Louis because he is the
oldest?"
</p>

<p>
"My son, I warn you that I shall live a long, long
while. You will all have a chance to make your own
fortunes and marry and have homes of your own. So
don't trouble about any such foolishness. And you are
all too young to consider the point."
</p>

<p>
"But people do in England."
</p>

<p>
"We are not in England," commented his father dryly.
</p>

<p>
"What a mess of nonsense has been talked at the
Pineries!" he said to his wife with some vexation afterward.
"Mr. Floyd has grown very grasping, and thinks
so much of money. And that boy puts on airs enough
for three grown-up fellows. Let children be children,
say I, and not bother their heads about the affairs of
older people. I'm sorry for Marian. Anyone can see
that her heart is not in this marriage. She's changed beyond
everything. But it is set for the spring. Dolly will
be more like to have her own way, as the Fates have sent
her an acceptable lover."
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline was all in a flurry to go to Washington, and
started at the first opportunity. The Carringtons had
begged for a week, as some cousins were coming, and they
were to give the young people a ball.
</p>

<p>
"You are a sad gadabout," sighed her father. "But
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_138' name='Page_138'>[138]</a></span>
you keep the house astir here with your coming and going.
It is time you began to learn something useful. I
shall look up a nice steady-going man of forty or thereabouts,
and marry you out of hand some day."
</p>

<p>
"Let me see&mdash;is there anyone near here that answers
the requirements?" and she laughed saucily as she put
her soft arms around her father's neck. "He must have
an estate, of course,&mdash;it will not do for me to fall behind-hand
in family dignity,&mdash;and a long pedigree. Do you
know whether the Masons, like the old Scotch woman's
ancestors, had a boat of their own at the time of the
flood?"
</p>

<p>
"I am pretty sure there must have been Masons," he
replied gravely.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Jettson received her with open arms. "Jaqueline,
have you any idea of how fortunate you are? Congress
is in session, and I have never known Washington
so gay. And the White House is fine in its new array,
while Mrs. Madison is as charming as ever. And Mrs.
Van Ness is giving the most elegant entertainments.
Roger Carrington was in here last evening to see if you
really were coming."
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Carrington gives a ball next Tuesday evening
for some young visitors. And I am invited over to
Georgetown for a week. So I just coaxed to come up
here a few days, for you would know about suitable
gowns. I don't suppose you have heard from
Marian?"
</p>

<p>
"Not a word. But Arthur told Lieutenant Ralston.
Really, my dear, he had half a mind to go up there and
tear her out of the family bosom by main force. He
couldn't believe it at first. He wrote a letter to Marian,
but I am certain no one could get it to her, although he
sent by a special messenger. I have given up. And
Dolly's engagement is announced. Mr. Floyd spoke before
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_139' name='Page_139'>[139]</a></span>
he went away. I had such a complacent letter from
mother. It made me angry, it really did. Well, her
whole duty is done, unless she lives to marry off her
granddaughters."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose Dolly is really in love?" Jaqueline had
not considered her very enthusiastic. She had a girl's
romantic ideal of love, fostered by the attention and affection
her father gave her stepmother. Had he loved
her own mother in that fashion?
</p>

<p>
"Dolly is a little ninny!" declared the elder sister in
disdain. "They all thought she was going wild over
that young Chase, but she seemed to drop him easy
enough. He is going to the bad as fast as possible,
though I don't believe in a woman wrecking her whole
life to save a man, for, after all, she rarely does it. And
I'm sorry to have Dolly go so far away. Oh, I <i>do</i> wonder
if I shall ever be glad to have baby Jaqueline marry
and go out of my sight! Yet I suppose having old
maids on your hands is rather mortifying. There are
some new shops on Pennsylvania Avenue, with such
pretty things, although there is so much talk about the
difficulty of getting goods from abroad. And everybody
complains of money being scarce, but there seems
a good deal to spend, some way."
</p>

<p>
Washington was certainly looking up. Handsome
houses were being built, and famous men were to be seen
in the streets and at the different entertainments. There
were weekly dinner parties at the White House, managed
with such tact that no one was affronted, those left
out knowing their turn would come next.
</p>

<p>
Jane and Mr. Jettson had an engagement that evening&mdash;"a
dinner where they are going to talk improvements
and the best way of getting a grant from Congress;
no dancing and no nice young men to flatter a
lady," declared Mr. Jettson. "Jane thinks them tiresome,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_140' name='Page_140'>[140]</a></span>
but she can put in a word now and then, since it is
our bread and butter."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'd rather stay at home! There is that 'Lay of
the Last Minstrel' to read. Who is this wonderful new
poet? Aunt Catharine made me read 'The Course of
Time' when I paid her my visit; aloud, too, so I couldn't
skip much, but it was dreadfully tiresome. This goes
along with a rush."
</p>

<p>
So Jaqueline settled herself in the easiest chair she
could find, and put her feet on the rounds of another.
The candles gave a softened light; but in spite of interest
she was getting drowsy when there was a hasty knock
and a discussion in the hall. Then Sam opened the door
and ushered in Lieutenant Ralston.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you won't think me a nuisance," as Jaqueline
was straightening herself up in some confusion, and feeling
if the knot of abundant hair was on the top of her
head or pushed over one side. "I'm sorry Mrs. Jettson
is out, and I recall the fact now that she had an engagement.
But I am very glad to see you, selfishly glad.
Do I interrupt anything important?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no!" She held out her hand cordially.
</p>

<p>
"You were up to the Pineries," he began abruptly.
"Did Marian seem&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"We didn't think her real happy." Jaqueline hesitated.
How much ought she to admit?
</p>

<p>
"I wrote her a letter. I wanted to know the truth.
You see, I have been perfectly honorable. I told her I
would wait seven years or twice seven years, and she
promised to do the same. I couldn't believe she accepted
this man of her own free will. And then I wrote, taking
precautions to have it reach her. It has been opened and
returned to me without a word. Here it is. That is
not Miss Floyd's handwriting."
</p>

<p>
"It is grandpapa's."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_141' name='Page_141'>[141]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Do you suppose she gave the letter to him?"
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid she must have. You see, the engagement
has been announced everywhere, and they sit together
in church. The neighbors give little companies
for them, and Mr. Greaves acts as if he had full right
to her."
</p>

<p>
Ralston dashed the letter to the floor. "Then she is
weak and false!" he cried in a passion. "I could wait
with very little encouragement, so long as it <i>was</i> waiting.
We are both young, and I have my fortune to make. But
when she engages herself to another, when&mdash;Mrs. Jettson
said there was talk of a marriage in the spring! Even if
she had written to explain&mdash;I think I could have stood
being given up by her if she had said it was a mistake,
and she had found she was over-hasty. It was sudden&mdash;done
in those two days; but then I had seen her frequently
during her visit to Mrs. Jettson, and I was sure
she cared for me. She had a kind of shy way&mdash;looking
back and forth; do you remember it? But perhaps the
glances are only meant for a lover's eyes," smiling faintly
in spite of the anger. "Either she loved me or she was a
coquette."
</p>

<p>
"She is not a coquette!" exclaimed Jaqueline decisively.
"And she never had a real lover until&mdash;"
Then the girl stopped and flushed.
</p>

<p>
"What I can't understand is her accepting this man if
she loved me, taking his caresses and his plans for a life
together&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he isn't the caressing sort!" interrupted Jaqueline.
"And yet I don't see how she could, if she loved
you. I wouldn't have been forced to accept him. I
wouldn't have promised anybody. I would just have
waited. But Grandfather Floyd is very arbitrary, and
when he makes up his mind, there is no relenting. Oh, I
am afraid you can't understand! You don't know him."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_142' name='Page_142'>[142]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"The time is past when a woman is compelled to marry
a man she doesn't want," he said with an angry sneer.
"I know the old adage says that a continual dropping will
wear away a stone. But this has been such a little while.
There may be shaly natures that the dropping disintegrates
rapidly. And you girls never talked with her
about it, which seems strange to me."
</p>

<p>
"We scarcely saw her alone. And we were strictly
forbidden to speak of it."
</p>

<p>
"Then he must have felt afraid of your influence."
</p>

<p>
Ralston looked eagerly at the girl, as if he was searching
for some ground of hope.
</p>

<p>
"It can't be changed any way, I think. Marian has accepted
it, and the whole neighborhood has congratulated
her. The wedding has been put down as a certainty."
</p>

<p>
"If I pity her I shall keep on loving her and thinking
something <i>may</i> happen. And if I believe her weak and
false I shall despise her and get over it. One couldn't
respect such a weak woman!"
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline wanted to make a protest. It was very hard
to be despised, and she thought Marian hardly deserved
that.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose this wouldn't have happened if I had been
the rich man," and there were lines of scorn about his
mouth.
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline knew it wouldn't. Did not money measure
most of the things in this life? And Lieutenant Ralston
was young, energetic, very good-looking, and delightful;
Mr. Greaves was thin, with a large nose, and high, narrow
forehead, his hair sprinkled with gray at the temples.
He was gentlemanly, but rather pompous; and
there was nothing entertaining about him, unless it was to
old Mr. Floyd. Marian had always seemed so young.
</p>

<p>
"If I knew who returned that letter! If I knew <i>she</i>
had seen it!" He was walking back and forth, and just
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_143' name='Page_143'>[143]</a></span>
touched it with the toe of his boot. It would have a curious
sacredness if it had been in her hands; her father's
hands and eyes made it a thing to be despised. Had he
sneered over it?
</p>

<p>
"I am quite sure she never saw it," returned Jaqueline
decisively.
</p>

<p>
He picked it up and threw it into the fire.
</p>

<p>
"You see," he began apologetically, "that I have come
to you and Mrs. Jettson because you were near to her and
knew her best. I dare say I have made myself quite
ridiculous, prating of love&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, not that!" she interrupted quickly. "And
I am so sorry it has come out this way. I was so interested
in it all, and even papa liked you so much."
</p>

<p>
That was comforting. He would be proud of the esteem
of such a man as Randolph Mason. Other men
had failed to win their first loves. Even Mr. Madison,
as the story went, had been positively engaged to a
charming young woman who had changed her mind
and married another. And where would one find a
more devoted couple than the President and his
wife, who had had her youthful love and misfortunes
and sorrows?
</p>

<p>
"When a man resolves to put a thing out of his mind
he can do it if he has any force of character." Ralston
held his head up very erect now, though he still kept pacing
the floor.
</p>

<p>
"That would be best," advised Jaqueline.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes; there is no use going about the world crying
for the moon, when the sun shines as much again, and
there is a good deal to do. So I shall not be a lovelorn
swain, but go on with an earnest effort, for I have some
ambitions, and though the times may seem tame by contrast
with the stirring events of our fathers', there are
still grave questions to study. It is not all froth and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_144' name='Page_144'>[144]</a></span>
amusement. I hope you are going to remain a while.
You're like a sister to Mrs. Jettson."
</p>

<p>
"I am invited to Georgetown for a week. And I think
I shall stay quite a while. It's so delightful here, and
rather dull at home. I do miss Patricia very much."
</p>

<p>
"And there is a ball at the Carringtons'. I am glad
you are to be there. Roger and I are fast friends. And
now have I not bored you enough? I will try to make
amends in the future. Will you tell Mrs. Jettson the result
of my letter? She warned me. Your father
warned me; but I suppose willful youth will have its own
way. Good-night. Let me see&mdash;there is a levee to-morrow
evening, and you have not seen the new plenishings
yet. We are very grand in yellow satin and damask.
If Mrs. Jettson is not engaged you must go."
</p>

<p>
"Poor Marian!" Jaqueline sighed, in relating the interview
to Jane and contrasting the lovers. "I don't believe
grandpapa could compel me, and she is so much
older, too. And when she sees Dolly's delight and happiness!"
</p>

<p>
"I have given her up," confessed Mrs. Jettson. "She
may be comfortable, and perhaps happier than at home.
Oh, Jaqueline, be thankful that your father doesn't belong
to the Floyd branch! For Brandon will be his father
right over again. There must be a sort of Puritan strand
in them. When you find me so stiff and strenuous you
had better banish me at once."
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline met some people at the levee who remembered
her, which was quite flattering to the young girl.
She hardly knew which of her cavaliers she admired
most, the fine-looking lieutenant or Mr. Carrington.
Both were made much of by the ladies, and cordially recognized
by the men of the period who were to be the
heroes of succeeding generations.
</p>

<p>
The ball was quite delightful. Though it was given
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_145' name='Page_145'>[145]</a></span>
for the young people, there were mothers and aunts, and
not a few fathers who dropped in later in the evening.
Young people were not left to themselves, and the elders
enjoyed seeing the pretty triumphs of their daughters
and telling little anecdotes of their own youth and their
conquests.
</p>

<p>
It was true that Lieutenant Ralston did not wear the
willow outwardly. Yet as time went on and his love for
Marian having nothing to feed upon chilled the warm
exultation of hope, he grew a trifle bitter at heart, and indulged
in some cynical reflections that had stings of wit.
Indeed, wit and repartee were largely cultivated then.
There were few books to talk about, except among the
learned men, who still affected classic lore. And it was
not considered a womanly accomplishment for the fair
sex to be versed in politics. It seems strange to us now
that there should have been so much talk in letters and
journals about finery and fashion, and who was paying
his addresses to this or that young damsel, and the furnishing
of someone's new house.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the women of that time were more discreet.
For Mrs. Madison must have been close in her husband's
confidence all those trying years, and known how to leave
a good deal unsaid. But general society then was for the
entertainment of all, and each one was expected to do his
or her share. Good-breeding was a virtue.
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline was gay enough. Virginian girls had a
charm and attractiveness besides mere beauty of feature.
So week by week her return home was put off,
until a visit from Dolly Floyd was announced. Mr.
Floyd was quite ailing, and his wife could not leave him.
Mrs. Mason was asked to consult with Mrs. Jettson and
see what was proper, and have the wedding trousseau
prepared, since Dolly was to go away, and there was
hardly time to send abroad. Mr. Floyd had insisted upon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_146' name='Page_146'>[146]</a></span>
a wedding just after Easter, as he was to go to New
York to attend to some business for his father, and he
would be delighted to have Dolly bear him company.
</p>

<p>
"But Marian?" exclaimed Mrs. Mason, when Dolly
had unfolded her budget.
</p>

<p>
"Marian insists that she won't be married until June.
And mother has given her that beautiful pearl-satin gown
in which she was married to papa, and after that she grew
so stout she could never wear it. But mother prefers
that she shall be married in white. Marian has grown to
be quite an old woman already; you can't think how queer
she is!"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Mason's heart went out with sympathy to her
young sister-in-law, who was trying in such a rigid
fashion to fit herself for her new life. Mrs. Jettson felt
rather hurt at first that the matter was not delegated
wholly to her, since the shopping and the work must be
done in Washington.
</p>

<p>
"But, you see, I am to get some things in New York
afterward, and Mrs. Marshall brought over some patterns
that her sister sent from Paris, and she is to send
us her mantua-maker. You know she had Sarah
trained, when they were over, to make frocks and caps
and mantles. She is to sew for Marian."
</p>

<p>
"And is Marian as happy as you?" asked Mrs. Jettson,
studying the young girl.
</p>

<p>
Dolly shrugged her shoulders. She was a flippant little
thing, occupied mostly with herself. Her own pleasure
came first.
</p>

<p>
"I don't see how she can be, with that stick of a lover.
I'm sure you can't compare him with Preston. But if
he suits her&mdash;and she's trying to take an interest in the
children. I think they're hideous. Oh, Jane, it is a
great shame the lieutenant hadn't been better off! He's
such a delightful fellow. There was a dreadful time
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_147' name='Page_147'>[147]</a></span>
about him. But, good gracious! I was not to say a
word," and Dolly turned pale.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know whether Marian had a letter from him
soon after the holidays?"
</p>

<p>
"Did he write? Why, that was romantic! No&mdash;I
do not believe it reached her. And if it had, it couldn't
have altered anything. Mr. Greaves is very much in
earnest, and Marian will have one of the finest houses
in the county. Then he talks of going to England and
leaving the two older children for their education. Some
cousin or uncle or relative died a while ago; and if someone
else should die he would come in for a title and a
fine estate. Father is quite elated over that. Father
should have been born an English aristocrat," and Dolly
laughed. "But if I wasn't so in love with Preston I
might be captured by the young soldier or some of the
beaus with which Washington abounds. Oh, dear! if
we could have come to the inauguration! I'm glad to go
away, for it's wretchedly dull all about the Pineries.
And Charleston is quite gay, Preston writes."
</p>

<p>
The shopping was done, and the gowns and coats and
pelisses left at Mrs. Sweeny's, who was quite celebrated
for her taste.
</p>

<p>
Then Dolly was suddenly summoned home. Her
father had a poorly spell, and Mr. Greaves had met with
an accident. As he was going to mount his horse one
morning to ride over to the Pineries, an owl that had
been nesting in a tree near the house made a flight across
the lawn, at which the horse shied and knocked down his
master, whose head struck the stepping-stone, and he had
lain unconscious ever since, but no bones were broken.
They had a hope that it would not prove serious, since
Mr. Greaves had an excellent constitution and had never
been ill a day in his life.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_148' name='Page_148'>[148]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">THE THORNS THAT BESET LOVE.</span>
</h2>

<p>
The spring was late this year, but when it came everything
burst into bloom and beauty as if by magic.
Even the marshy ends of the streets in Washington were
covered with verdure and the curious delicate bloom of
the different sedge growths. Congress kept on. There
were many perplexing questions, and war loomed in the
distance.
</p>

<p>
The festivities at the Pineries were quite interrupted.
When Mr. Greaves recovered consciousness it was found
that his right side had been partially paralyzed. His
speech was affected, and the doctor spoke doubtfully of
his mind.
</p>

<p>
Consequently all thoughts of Marian's marriage must
be given up for the present. But Dolly's went on, and the
last week in April the impatient lover presented himself,
and the family relatives and friends were gathered to celebrate
the occasion. It was considered most proper for
Louis Mason to attend Marian, who was to be the first
bridesmaid. Jaqueline was next in order, and there were
three others. Weddings were quite sumptuous affairs in
those days. There was a great supper and dancing; one
of the bride-cakes held a ring, put in by the hand of the
bride-elect, and great was the interest to see who would
get it. This fell to Jaqueline. And when the bride was
escorted upstairs by her bevy of maidens she paused on
the landing and scattered her half-dozen roses which had
been sent from Washington, and cost extravagantly. The
first one did not go far, and caught in Jaqueline's shoulder-knot.
There was a general laughing exclamation.
</p>

<p>
"And I haven't even a lover!" cried the girl with
dainty mock regret.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_149' name='Page_149'>[149]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
There was a grand breakfast the next morning&mdash;a real
breakfast, not a noon luncheon. Many of the guests had
remained all night. Mirth and jollity reigned, good-wishes
were given, healths were drunk, and at noon the
young couple started on their long stage-coach journey.
Tours were hardly considered then, though the bride
often journeyed to the house of her husband's nearest
relatives. But to take in Baltimore and Philadelphia
was enough to set one up for life, and Dolly was very
much elated. The return trip would be made by water,
so she would be quite a traveled bride.
</p>

<p>
Marian had been the sedate elder sister. She was not
old, but she had grown much older and lost the aspect of
girlhood that she had kept her three-and-twenty years.
There was much kindly sympathy expressed for her.
Mr. Greaves grew more helpless instead of improving,
and his mind had never been quite clear.
</p>

<p>
But no one suggested an interrupted engagement except
among the slaves, who recalled that she had put out
her candle on Christmas Eve, and the ring in the cake had
not come to her, nor a single rose.
</p>

<p>
"Looks laik she cut out fer 'n ole maid," declared a
gray-haired mammy. "En she mought 'a' bin a gret
lady, goin' ober to de ole country. But young missy goin'
to be happy as de day is long. De house'll never seem de
same."
</p>

<p>
"Grandfather Floyd has begun to break," said Mr.
Mason when they had started on their homeward journey.
"One can hardly decide whether to be glad or sorry about
Marian. Anyway, it is hard on the poor girl."
</p>

<p>
"And you can't decide whether she is sorry or not.
I never saw anyone change so. She has grown curiously
close about herself," declared Jaqueline.
</p>

<p>
The interrupted intimacy between the two families was
taken up again. Even Jane and her three children were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_150' name='Page_150'>[150]</a></span>
invited to the Pineries for a hot month in the summer.
Grandfather was quite deaf, which made him more irritable,
and Marian played piquet with him for hours together.
Mrs. Floyd managed the plantation, though she
had always taken her share of that.
</p>

<p>
Patricia came home a slim, pretty, and piquant young
woman, refined and finished, and Louis was an attractive
young collegian. The house was filled with guests, and
there was much merriment, until one day the word came
that surprised them all. Grandfather had been found
dead in his chair on the porch where he took his usual
afternoon nap.
</p>

<p>
Family funerals were almost as grand occasions as marriages
at this period. The great house was filled with
guests, and there was no unseemly haste to bury the dead
out of their sight. The funeral procession might have
been that of a famous man. When they returned the
relatives were gathered in the darkened parlor where the
candles stood lighted on a table, and Archibald Floyd's
will was read in a dry, decorous tone by the little old lawyer
who had made wills for half a century.
</p>

<p>
As was expected, the Pineries and slaves and appurtenances
of all kinds went to Brandon, who was the only
son. The girls had an equal money portion. The widow
was provided with a home; certain rooms were set apart
for her, certain slaves were bequeathed to her with the bed
and table linen and some of the furnishings that she had
brought with her; and Brandon was to pay her a regular
income out of the estate, which was to cease at her death.
A very fair and just will, it was agreed on every side.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile there had been no perceptible change in Mr.
Greaves. He did not suffer much; he was fed and cared
for like a child. Some days he brightened and talked
with encouraging coherence, but it was mostly about his
early life, and he now and then mistook his sister for his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_151' name='Page_151'>[151]</a></span>
dead wife. And though Marian had gone over several
times, he had not seemed to recall her specially.
</p>

<p>
Miss Greaves was in her element. She had not taken
kindly to the prospect of being deposed, though the
training of women in her day led them to accept the inevitable
without complaining. She was rather proud,
too, that her brother had won a young woman; and Marian's
sudden gravity after her engagement had given her
considerable satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
"The doctor holds out very little hope of perfect recovery,"
she said to the younger woman at one call.
"He thinks brother's mind will never be quite right
again. He has a good appetite now and sleeps well, but
it is very sad to be stricken down in the very prime of
life. On our mother's side we are a long-lived race. I
had an aunt who lay paralyzed for seven years, and was
eighty when she died."
</p>

<p>
Marian shuddered. Her father's failing health had
demanded most of her attention. Was she in any way
relieved? She tried not to think of it. No one referred
to the marriage, except now and then some of the slaves,
who counted up all the bad signs in an awesome fashion.
</p>

<p>
Dolly had enjoyed everything to the uttermost, and
was delighted with her new home and her new relatives.
Communication between even the most important cities
was tardy at that time, and often sent by private messenger.
Yet the political interest of the States was kept up
keenly, almost to rivalry. New England, whose commerce
had been injured the most, complained loudly.
The States were between two fires. England was bringing
all her power to bear upon the Emperor Napoleon.
Neither country paid any attention to the rights of neutrals.
There was the old romantic remembrance of
France coming to our assistance in our mighty struggle
with the mother country; but there were a hundred relationships
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_152' name='Page_152'>[152]</a></span>
with England where there was one with France,
and Napoleon's ruthlessness had alienated the noblest
sense of the community.
</p>

<p>
Yet living went on in the lavish, cordial Virginian fashion
at the old plantation, if it was not quite so full of gayety.
There were two attractive young women now, and
the young men were haunting the house, planning riding
parties and a day's outing to some grove or wood, a sail
down or up the Potomac, and a three-days' visit to some
neighbor who rather regretfully gave up dancing on account
of the recent death. Louis had been putting in law
with his other studies, and was not to graduate for
another year.
</p>

<p>
Roger Carrington was now a steady visitor, and all the
household knew he was young missy's lover. Her father's
assent had been cordially given. Her own was still in
abeyance. Jaqueline had a willful streak in her nature.
If someone had opposed, she would have sided at once
with her lover. But everybody agreed. Mrs. Carrington
treated her as a daughter already, and longed to have the
engagement announced. Roger pleaded.
</p>

<p>
"I want to be quite sure that I love you better than
anybody," she would say with a kind of dainty sweetness.
"If one <i>should</i> make a mistake!"
</p>

<p>
"But we are such friends already. We have been for a
long time. Surely if you disliked me you would have
found it out before this."
</p>

<p>
"But I don't dislike you. I like you very much. Only
it seems that things which come so easy&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She let her lovely eyes droop, and the color came and
went in her face. How exquisite her rose-leaf cheeks
were! He wished he had the right to kiss them fifty
times an hour. A husband would have. But there was a
fine courtesy between lovers of that day. And there was
always some curling tendril of shadowy hair clustering
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_153' name='Page_153'>[153]</a></span>
about her fair temples. Her ear, too, was like a bit of
sculpture, and the lines that went down her neck and lost
themselves in the roundness of her shoulders changed
with every motion, each one prettier than the last, and
were distractingly tempting.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure it doesn't come easy to me," he said in a
rather curt tone.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, doesn't it? I thought there really was no mistaking
the grand passion on a man's part&mdash;that he was convinced
in the flash of an eye."
</p>

<p>
"It is when he wishes to convince that his doubt
arises. If I could persuade you&mdash;" longingly.
</p>

<p>
"I am always afraid I shall be too easily persuaded,"
she returned plaintively. "I sometimes wonder if I really
have a good strong mind of my own. Do you know, I
should like to be one of the heroic women; then in case
war should come&mdash;there are such talks about it, you know&mdash;and
I <i>had</i> to send you away&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She looked so utterly bewitching that he had much ado
not to clasp her to his heart.
</p>

<p>
"You are heroic enough. And you are tormenting to
the last degree. I wonder sometimes if you even like
me!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you know I like you," carelessly.
</p>

<p>
"If you would once say 'I love you.' You like so
many people&mdash;young men, I mean."
</p>

<p>
"Why, when you have been brought up with them, so
to speak&mdash;" and she looked up out of large, innocent
eyes. "There are the Bakers, you know. Georgie, Rob,
Teddy, and I have played together always. Would you
have me turn haughty now?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't mind the Bakers, and Teddy is as good as engaged
to Hester Fairfax, who really does adore him."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I think she does," gravely. "He is always describing
her perfections and her sweetnesses, as if we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_154' name='Page_154'>[154]</a></span>
hadn't quarreled and declared we wouldn't speak to each
other and done little spiteful tricks that girls always do,
and&mdash;and gotten over it, and know all about each other."
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe you were ever very spiteful. That
takes a small nature."
</p>

<p>
She looked furtively from under her long lashes, as if
considering.
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;Patty and I quarrel. You must know that I
haven't the most amiable temper in the world when I am
roused."
</p>

<p>
"Yes." She could be very tormenting.
</p>

<p>
"And I like to have my own way. Papa generally
gives in. And sometimes I feel self-condemned that
mamma is so good to me."
</p>

<p>
"Then you have a conscience?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe my own mother would have been so
easy. And there's grandmamma&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Who would have led you to find out your mind in
short order," he commented quickly.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Her</i> mind, you mean. And if she had resolved that
I shouldn't marry you, you would have been sent to the
right-about at once. And that reminds me&mdash;Lieutenant
Ralston is coming down next week. But I suppose you
are not afraid of him, since his heart is&mdash;oh, can you
tell where it is? Sometimes I think he still cares for
Marian, and then he is so bitter and sharp. She won't
ever marry Mr. Greaves now."
</p>

<p>
She looked so eager and earnest, as if this was the main
question of her life. He turned away with a pang at his
heart. Was she anything but a volatile, teasing girl, with
no deep feelings?
</p>

<p>
"You shan't! I say you shan't! Annis belongs to me.
You shan't take her away. We're going to row round
the pond&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Louis laughed with a soft sound of triumph.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_155' name='Page_155'>[155]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"But you promised to ride with me, didn't you, Annis?
And I don't see how Annis belongs to you especially.
You're too old for that boyish foolishness. Why, you
couldn't marry her in years and years, and then she'd be
an old woman, queer and cross. Hillo!" in a surprised
tone.
</p>

<p>
They faced Mr. Carrington and Jaqueline.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Louis, why do you tease the children so?" exclaimed
Jaqueline in disapprobation.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not teasing you, Annis, am I? We were to go
for a ride, and her pony is all ready, when Charles flew
into a passion."
</p>

<p>
"I told you Scipio was getting the boat ready&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But I didn't think you meant to-day. You said it
leaked and had to be repaired, and this morning&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She glanced up at Louis entreatingly.
</p>

<p>
"This morning I told her we would go down to the
creek and see the great flock of ducks Julius has been
raising. Annis belongs as much to me as to you. She
belongs to us all. And how do you know but that I'll
marry her myself? I'm very fond of Annis. And I'm
grown up. In a few years I may be a judge, or be sent
abroad to smooth out some quarrel or make a treaty,
while you will be in school studying your Cicero. Annis
will be a big girl, old enough to marry. And you like me,
don't you, Annis?"
</p>

<p>
He had his arm around the child. He had been very
sweet to her of late, partly to tease Varina, and partly because
she interested him curiously. She said such quaint
things; she could seem to understand almost everything.
And when he declaimed a fine Latin poem with vigor and
loftiness, her eyes would follow him, her face would glow
and change with emotion and appreciation. Then he had
been teaching her some pretty songs.
</p>

<p>
"I like you both," she returned in a tender, entreating
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_156' name='Page_156'>[156]</a></span>
voice, as if begging each one to be content with the regard.
Yet she made no motion to leave him, and both
slim hands were clasped around the young man's arm.
</p>

<p>
"But you must like me the best," and now he put his
arm about her, drawing her closer to his side. "It's this
way. First your mother&mdash;always; then father, who is
very fond of you, little Annis; then me, then Jaqueline,
and you see Charles stands way down at the bottom of
the line. Of course you can't love him quite so much; it
wouldn't be fair to the rest of us."
</p>

<p>
Annis looked perplexed with the reasoning. She
glanced at Charles, then hid her face in the elder brother's
coat. He made a rush at her, but Louis caught him and
held him off at arm's length.
</p>

<p>
"You're a mean&mdash;mean skunk, that's what you are!"
The boy's face was scarlet with passion, and his voice
choked. "She won't love you best, will you, Annis? For
he likes all the girls, the big ladies, and I don't care for
anyone but just you."
</p>

<p>
"Louis, do stop! You ought to be ashamed.
Charles&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But Louis let go of his little brother's arm, who ran a
few steps with the impetus and then tumbled over. Louis
caught the little girl in both arms,&mdash;she was slim and
light,&mdash;and ran swiftly with her. Jaqueline picked up
Charles, who was crying now in a passion of anger, exclaiming
between the sobs:
</p>

<p>
"I just hate him, I do! He shan't take away Annis.
She belongs to me."
</p>

<p>
"Charles, don't be so foolish. You can't have Annis
every hour in the day, and if you go on this way she'll
just hate you. Why, I am ashamed of you! And here is
Mr. Carrington."
</p>

<p>
"I don't care. I made Scip mend the boat, 'n' he said
Dixon would be awful mad and maybe have him flogged.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_157' name='Page_157'>[157]</a></span>
Where's father? I'll go and tell him how it was, and
Scip may tear the old boat to pieces, but he shan't be
flogged. Louis thinks he's great shakes because he's
older and bigger&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But he will be married before you and Annis are
grown up, so don't worry. He loves to tease you. Now
go and find father."
</p>

<p>
"He is taking love early and hard," said Mr. Carrington.
</p>

<p>
"It's such ridiculous nonsense! Mamma doesn't like
it a bit, but father thinks it a good joke. It makes
Charles appear silly. But he will go away to school and
have new interests. And in a few years Annis won't
want to be claimed in that masterful fashion."
</p>

<p>
They walked along silently. Mr. Mason sat out under
a great tree, smoking his pipe and listening to Charles.
</p>

<p>
"Let them finish their confidence. I'll take the hammock,
and you may read to me." She did not want to
discuss love any more just now.
</p>

<p>
Annis was borne triumphantly to her pony. Louis
placed her in the saddle.
</p>

<p>
"You do love me, little Annis, do you not?" and he
kissed her tenderly. He had a very sweet way that you
could not gainsay when it was turned upon you, and a
child certainly could not resist. "Now we will have a
nice gallop, and then a rest down by the creek where it
is shady, ever so much nicer than the sunny pond and the
old boat. You know I asked you first."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't think Charles meant this very afternoon,"
she said regretfully. "And I'm so sorry he&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind about a boy's temper. Look at that fire
bird&mdash;isn't he gorgeous? There's where the lightning
struck that great pine tree the other night and split it
in two."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, poor tree! Do you suppose it hurt very much!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_158' name='Page_158'>[158]</a></span>
And the half stands up as if nothing could ever make it
afraid. There are the branches all withering on the
ground. Were you very much frightened? It kills people
sometimes, doesn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Very seldom. And a great many things kill them.
Accidents and falls, and sickness, so the few struck by
lightning are hardly to be taken into account."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, look at the great field of corn! It is like a sea."
</p>

<p>
The tassels had turned yellow, and the wind stirred
them, making golden waves.
</p>

<p>
"What do you know about the sea?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, when we went down the Potomac. You were
not home."
</p>

<p>
"I've been down there though, and out on the ocean."
</p>

<p>
"Would you be afraid to go to England?"
</p>

<p>
"Not of the ocean, but I might be of the privateers.
And I should not want to be caught and impressed, and
made to fight. But I mustn't fill my little lady-love with
frightful subjects."
</p>

<p>
The child's cheek warmed with a dainty color. Could
anyone be a lady-love to two persons? That was what
Charles called her.
</p>

<p>
Squirrels were scurrying here and there. The goldenrod
was nodding on tall stalks, and some asters starred
the wayside. Afar was a broad stretch of tobacco fields
in their peculiar deep-green luxuriance. Birds were
calling to each other, insects were droning, the monotony
broken by a shrill chirr as a grasshopper leaped up from
the path or a locust predicted a hot to-morrow from his
leafy covert. They crossed broad sunny patches that
looked like a dried-up sea, they lingered under fragrant
pines and great oaks and maples that shaded the road,
and Annis laughed at her companion's comments and
the merry stories he told. She had been used to standing
somewhat in awe of him, but this summer he had quite
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_159' name='Page_159'>[159]</a></span>
overcome her shyness. Sometimes she did get a little
tired of the knowledge Charles poured into her ears.
Latin orations had not much charm for her, in their unknown
tongue, and only the inflections of the boy's musical
voice rendered them tolerable. She liked the deeds
of heroes rather than what they said, and their loves
rather than their fighting or their harangues.
</p>

<p>
At home Charles had thrown himself on the half-dried
turf and given way to another burst of passion such as
seldom moved him. That Louis should take Annis away
from him, his chosen friend and companion, and that she
should go without a protest! Was she really liking
Louis, who was grown up and who could have his pick of
the pretty young women always coming to the house.
Why should he want Annis?
</p>

<p>
It was the boy's first experience with a rival, and as he
had never dreamed of such an untoward event, he could
not understand the pain. It was like a storm that
had been threatening in the southeast while the west was
still clear, and now had suddenly blown up and enveloped
the whole sky. Though he was not much given to tears,
or anger, for that matter, the tempest surged over him
now, and as it was furious it was the shorter lived.
</p>

<p>
Presently a laugh stung him, and he raised his head,
but he knew the sound of the voice.
</p>

<p>
"Do go away, Varina!" he exclaimed sharply.
</p>

<p>
"Can't I walk where I like? When you get a house
and a plantation of your own, you may order me off. Or
you may even set the dogs on me."
</p>

<p>
"Don't be so silly, so hateful." He was shocked at
her last remark, and sprang up, brushing off the twigs
and bits of dried grass.
</p>

<p>
"It is you who are silly, making a dunce of yourself
over Annis. Of course she cares for you when there
is no one else by. That's just the way with girls. Look
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_160' name='Page_160'>[160]</a></span>
at Jaqueline. When Mr. Tayloe or Mr. Bedford are
here she's sweet to them, then comes the lieutenant and
she sends the others to the right-about-face, then he goes
and it's all Mr. Carrington. When he is gone she will
take up with Mr. Bedford. I like him. He's so funny
and sings such splendid songs."
</p>

<p>
Charles was standing up very straight. Indeed, he
seemed to stretch out his slim figure, and the gravity of
his face had scarcely a boyish line in it.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean that Jaqueline doesn't care for any of
them? Patty said she was as good as engaged to Mr.
Carrington, and that we could have a nicer wedding than
Dolly Floyd's."
</p>

<p>
Varina shrugged her shoulders. There was always an
eerie flavor about the child's strictures. "She cares for
them all when they are here. Oh, gracious! Suppose
they should all come together!" and she laughed. "But
she'd rather take them one by one, and have a good time.
That's the way I mean to do. You have more good
times."
</p>

<p>
"Annis isn't a bit like you!" the boy flung out hotly.
He could not understand; it had not come time for analysis
or fine gradations; he only suffered, without the
power of reasoning.
</p>

<p>
"Annis is a girl; and girls are all alike. And there's
Mr. Carrington alone. I wonder if Jacky's been cross
to him. I shall go and walk with him."
</p>

<p>
She ran down the little side path. Mr. Carrington had
started with the intention of finding Charles and comforting
him, for it had been with him as Varina surmised,
but the talk between them had arrested him. Was it
true that a girl found pleasure in variety rather than
constancy? He was amused at Varina's wisdom, and
yet it had in it a savor of sad truth. Annis' little winsome
face as Louis caught her came back to him.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_161' name='Page_161'>[161]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"The Sabine women learned to love their husbands,"
he mused, when Varina called to him. He had to exercise
some ingenuity to parry the child's curiosity, since
he was by far too gentlemanly to take advantage of it.
</p>

<p>
Charles was a little sullen that evening, and took no
notice of the timid little olive branch Annis held out.
Presently, warm as the night was, he went off to his
books.
</p>

<p>
"Louis, you tease him too much," said his father.
</p>

<p>
"It's high time someone took him in hand. He is getting
to be a regular little prig! You ought to send him
away to school."
</p>

<p>
"He doesn't seem quite the boy for that. We'll see as
he gets older. But I won't have any quarreling about
Annis. Annis belongs to me, don't you, little girl? And
we'll marry off all the rest of them, and you and I and
mother will live together the remainder of our lives,"
kissing her with tenderness.
</p>

<p>
When they all went away&mdash;and she loved them all&mdash;how
lonesome it would be!
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">A TALK OF WEDDINGS.</span>
</h2>

<p>
"You must decide and answer me, Jaqueline. You
know I love you. The marriage would be pleasing
to both sides of the family. My holiday is over, and I
must rejoin my chief. I want the matter settled. If you
are not convinced that you can love me, I shall take it
as a sign that there is very little hope for me&mdash;none at all,
in fact&mdash;and go my way."
</p>

<p>
There was something rather stern in the tone, and the
pretty girl's humor protested. She liked the tender wooing,
the graceful compliments, the sort of uncertainty
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_162' name='Page_162'>[162]</a></span>
when she could salve her conscience by saying she was
not really engaged and feel compelled to hold herself aloof
from certain attentions. For whatever coquetries a Virginia
girl might indulge in, an engagement was sacred.
</p>

<p>
"I do wonder if you really love me?" She longed to
temporize. There was always something happening,
and now there was to be a week's party at Annapolis and
a ball and several sailing excursions. Business would
interfere with his going. If she could keep free until
after that!
</p>

<p>
He looked at her steadily. "If you doubt it after my
year of devotion, I hardly know how to convince you.
Words will not do it. You <i>must</i> believe it."
</p>

<p>
"For it would be a sad thing for either of us to make
a mistake," she returned plaintively.
</p>

<p>
"You asked for three months to consider. And yet
you admitted that you cared for me even then. If your
love has not increased any in that time it certainly argues
ill for me. And now it must be a plain answer, yes or
no. It is foolish to trifle this way. Which is it, Jaqueline?"
</p>

<p>
He took both her hands in his and impelled her to meet
his eyes. Her face was scarlet, her eyes drooped, her
expression was so beseeching that it almost conquered
him as it had times before. But he was going away
with Mr. Monroe, and it would be a month before he saw
her again.
</p>

<p>
"Yes or no!"
</p>

<p>
"You are cruel." Her eyes filled with tears. She
felt his hands tremble, strong as they were.
</p>

<p>
"Then it must be no, if you cannot say yes. Jaqueline,
I am more than sorry. You are the first girl that
ever roused in me the sweet desire to have her for my
very own. I may never find another to whom I can give
the same regard. But I want no unwilling bride."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_163' name='Page_163'>[163]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
He dropped the hands reluctantly. He half turned, as
if that was final.
</p>

<p>
"Roger&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She so often evaded his name. What an entrancing
sound it had! And it softened him.
</p>

<p>
"You are so masterful," and her voice had a little
break in it. "I am afraid I could not be a meek, silly
wife with no mind of her own, but a mocking-bird
echo of her husband's. When I feel quite sure I love
you&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Is there any such blessed moment?" He took her
in his arms. "I have sometimes felt in my inmost soul
there was, and this certainly pays for hours of doubt. I
do not care to have you meek; and silly women I abhor.
I only want this one point settled. After that you will
find me devoted to your slightest whims."
</p>

<p>
"Then I suppose I must&mdash;" with a fascinating reluctance.
</p>

<p>
"There is no compulsion. You either give me your
sweet, fresh girl's soul to bloom in the garden of manhood's
unalterable love, freely and rejoicingly, or I go
my solitary way."
</p>

<p>
"Do not go. I could not spare you. Are you quite
sure you will not prove a tyrant?"
</p>

<p>
For answer he kissed her, then held her in a gentle yet
strong embrace.
</p>

<p>
"And you love me?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, how hard you are to satisfy!"
</p>

<p>
"Still, you will say it?"
</p>

<p>
"I love you. Will that satisfy your lordship? Now if
I were a princess you could not be so hard to satisfy. A
nod would answer."
</p>

<p>
"You are <i>my</i> princess. Now let us go and find your
father. I am afraid he has had a rather low opinion of
my powers of persuasion."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_164' name='Page_164'>[164]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
They were under the great plane tree. Annis was
taking a lesson in hemstitching at her mother's
knee.
</p>

<p>
"We have come for your blessing," began the happy
lover.
</p>

<p>
"Which I give gladly. I could not have chosen better
for Jaqueline if I had gone half over the world, or
at least a son-in-law more acceptable to myself. If I
wish you as much happiness as I have had, your cup will
be full."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Mason rose and kissed the girl with fervent affection.
"We all like him so," she whispered to Jaqueline.
"Your father will be as happy as your lover."
</p>

<p>
"Come and give us joy, little Annis. I hope Charles
won't protest at your having a new brother."
</p>

<p>
"But he likes you so," answered the child simply.
"And you never tease him."
</p>

<p>
"Charles must learn not to be such a ninny," declared
his father.
</p>

<p>
The supper was almost a betrothal feast. For a wonder,
there were no guests. But before bedtime every
slave on the plantation knew it, and great was the rejoicing.
And the next morning numerous little gifts
were brought for Jaqueline's acceptance. And now
Roger hated to go away. How could he be content with
this one brief sup of happiness?
</p>

<p>
"We must go up to the Pineries," Mr. Mason said.
"Your grandmother would feel hurt if she were not informed
at once. And&mdash;are you going next week?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, of course. I even asked Mr. Carrington. Was
not that dutiful?"
</p>

<p>
Her father laughed. "Jaqueline, you need a strong
hand. You have had your way too much."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know why everyone thinks I ought to be
ruled like a baby," she pouted.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_165' name='Page_165'>[165]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Jack, you are going to have one of the best husbands.
Remember that."
</p>

<p>
It was not until afternoon that they started, and were
to remain all night. As there was room for one more,
Annis went with them. It hardly seemed like the same
place, Jaqueline thought, and she decided she liked grandpapa
much better than Uncle Brandon. He insisted upon
the relationship having the right name, and was quite as
great a stickler for attention as his father had been;
but where Mr. Floyd's was really a fine old-fashioned
dignity, Brandon's seemed more pretentious.
</p>

<p>
His wife was one of the ordinary women of that day,
whose duty under all circumstances was to her husband.
Master Archie put on many consequential airs.
</p>

<p>
"I am glad you are going to do so well," said grandmother.
"The Carringtons are a good family, and their
father left a nice property, which must be very valuable.
I must look among my treasures and see what I can spare
for you. Dolly had my rubies&mdash;they were her choice;
and my pearls were for Marian. That was a sad and
sore disappointment to us all. There seems very little
hope of amendment in the case."
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline and Marian walked up and down in the fragrant
twilight.
</p>

<p>
"You don't mean that you still consider yourself engaged?"
queried the young girl in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"But nothing has been said, and I don't know what
can be said now. You see, papa made his will quite a
long while ago, and when there was the talk about Lieutenant
Ralston he said if I encouraged him&mdash;if I married
against his wishes&mdash;he would not leave me anything, and
everybody should know it was because I had been a disobedient,
ungrateful child. Think of having it read out
before all the relatives! And you know he did not alter
the will. He gave Jane less because he had given her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_166' name='Page_166'>[166]</a></span>
part of her portion on her wedding day. Jane had it
very easy, I think, considering that Mr. Jettson had no
fortune to speak of except those Washington marshes.
But Jane's had a nice time and plenty of friends. Only,
you see, now I feel bound by the will. Papa trusted me.
He had a feeling that Mr. Greaves might recover&mdash;he was
so strong, and had always been well. But we never
talked it over, for no one really was thinking of papa's
death."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know, Marian, I consider you a very foolish
girl&mdash;superstitious, as well? No one can expect you
to marry Mr. Greaves," said Jaqueline emphatically.
</p>

<p>
"Of course not now. But if he should have his mind
a little while and give me up, I should feel quite free,
you know."
</p>

<p>
"And you mean to wait for that?" indignantly.
</p>

<p>
"I am not <i>waiting</i>. Papa has been dead such a little
while that it would be indecent to traverse his wishes at
once. And Mr. Greaves loved me, he really did; you
need not look so incredulous! Not like&mdash;a younger man,
perhaps," making a little halt. "He planned so many
things for my pleasure. We were to go to England. He
and papa agreed so well on politics."
</p>

<p>
"And you are an American girl! Please don't forget
that grandmother's father was at the surrender of
Cornwallis, and we are all proud of it! He is your ancestor,
too. And the Masons were all on the side of liberty
and a country for ourselves."
</p>

<p>
"I think women are not much concerned in politics,"
she replied evasively. "But it <i>is</i> pleasanter to have all
your people of one belief. It does seem as if the
Church should have something to do with the government.
I don't understand it, but it appears Christian
and proper."
</p>

<p>
"After all, it is the people who make the country, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_167' name='Page_167'>[167]</a></span>
the Church too. And it ought to be what the people
want, the majority of them."
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline's tone carried a penetrating conviction, yet
Marian steeled her heart against it. The people certainly
were an aggregate of individuals; and if everyone insisted
upon having his own way, anarchy must ensue.
But she could not reason on the subject, even in Jaqueline's
girlish fashion. Argument was reprehensible in
women.
</p>

<p>
"Then you just mean to wait!" There was an accent
of disappointment in Jaqueline's tone.
</p>

<p>
"There is nothing else to do. I certainly must respect
papa's wishes."
</p>

<p>
"You've changed so, Marian."
</p>

<p>
"Remember, Jaqueline, I am years older than you," she
replied with dignity. "And now I have to be mother's
companion. She misses father very much. I'm glad to
have you happy, and everyone is pleased with your engagement.
It is a very excellent one."
</p>

<p>
"The excellence wouldn't go very far if it did not please
me," returned the younger girl. "My happiness and
pleasure are a personal affair, not simply the satisfaction
of others."
</p>

<p>
"I hope you will be very happy," reiterated Marian.
"Dolly is. Mother thinks her letters are quite frivolous;
they are all about dinners and visits and parties. She
doesn't go to the very gay ones, but she writes about them.
Charleston must be quite as fashionable as Washington,
to judge from the gowns and entertainments. But Dolly
is not keeping house, though she has her rooms and her
maid."
</p>

<p>
Then the two girls lapsed into silence as they walked
up and down. Jaqueline was thinking that next week
Lieutenant Ralston would be her cavalier, and she had
ardently wished to reawaken hope in his breast, in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_168' name='Page_168'>[168]</a></span>
place of the disesteem in which he held Marian&mdash;indeed,
nearly all women; though he occasionally said: "I can't
imagine you or Mrs. Jettson doing such a thing!" That
was really flattering. Of course she should tell him of
<i>her</i> engagement, and they would still be friends.
</p>

<p>
Louis was to be of the party, and they started off in
high spirits.
</p>

<p>
"Jaqueline ought to sober down a little," said her
father. "And there is no need of a long engagement.
The Carringtons will be anxious for the marriage&mdash;well,"
laughingly, "more anxious than we. But I think
most men are pleased when their daughters marry well.
And we have four."
</p>

<p>
"We need not think of the younger ones for several
years," Mrs. Mason said with a smile.
</p>

<p>
"Varina ought to go to school somewhere, or to
Aunt Catharine. Patty improved wonderfully. And
Charles&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I think Charles is doing very well. Louis admits
that he studies beyond his years. And he seems to me
not over-robust. I would certainly wait another year."
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline begged her brother to say nothing about the
engagement. It was so recent, and she would not be
married in some time.
</p>

<p>
"You'll be flirting with everybody."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't grudge me a week's pleasure! After that
I will be as staid as any grandmother."
</p>

<p>
"Carrington isn't the fellow to stand much nonsense
when the rights are all on his side. I advise you to be
careful."
</p>

<p>
"Why, I am going to be, even now. Of course Mr.
Ralston is different from the others. We have been
friends so long."
</p>

<p>
Ralston was safe enough, Louis thought. And one
couldn't quite blame Jaqueline. She did not flirt openly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_169' name='Page_169'>[169]</a></span>
like Betty Fairfax; and now Betty was devotion itself
to her lover, and she was to be married in the early
autumn. In fact, Louis had not felt satisfied to be so
entirely crowded out when he had been one of Betty's
favorites.
</p>

<p>
Girls were queer, he mused. Then he threw himself into
the round of pleasures, which in those days were really
made for enjoyment. No one thought of being bored.
The world was fresh and young, and had not been
traversed by theories and sciences and experiences of
tired generations. Everyone felt he or she had a right
to at least one draught of the nectar of youth.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant Ralston had come with the hope that Jaqueline
would bring him some message to light the future.
Of course if Marian had been married that would have
been the end of all things. He had too fine a sense of
honor to covet another man's wife. But it seemed as if
Providence had intervened. Mr. Floyd was dead and
Mr. Greaves out of the lists by a stroke of fate. And
since Marian was free, he was at liberty to give his fancy
unlimited play once more.
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline was indignant that Marian had not gladly
grasped her liberty, but still hugged the chain of another's
selecting. Perhaps her feelings colored her words, although
she strove to be fair and make allowance for the
superstitious reverence in which the girl seemed to hold
her father. Or was it really fear?
</p>

<p>
"I thought I had not hoped any, but circumstances
coming out this way seemed an interposition in my behalf,"
admitted Mr. Ralston. "And I found it very easy
to go back to that delightful experience. Even now that
you have a lover, Miss Jaqueline, I think you hardly understand
how a man loves and how willing he is to pick
up the faintest shred of hope and dream that it may
blossom anew, or rather that the bud, having been crushed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_170' name='Page_170'>[170]</a></span>
by another's ruthlessness, has still in it strength enough
to unfold in fragrance when nursed carefully by the man
who thinks no other bloom could ever be so sweet.
Perhaps I was a fool for this second dream. I tried to
shut it out, but it stole in unawares. She hasn't been
worth it all, nor any of it, I see that plainly now."
</p>

<p>
"Poor Marian!" The love moved the girl with infinite
pity for the woman who had lost it and was trying
to feed on husks.
</p>

<p>
"No, don't pity her; she isn't worth it," and his tone
was bitterly resentful. "I could have overlooked the
weakness that made her yield to her tyrannical father;
but now when she could be free, when she knows there
awaits her the sacred welcome of love, it is plain that
she does not care. Perhaps she is still counting on a fortune
coming to her as if by a miracle, for she has no great
deal of her own."
</p>

<p>
"No, no; it is not that," protestingly.
</p>

<p>
"It looks mightily like it."
</p>

<p>
"Marian has a queer conscience. You don't
know&mdash;" Did she really know Marian herself?
</p>

<p>
"Well, we will dismiss her now. Perhaps she has a
high order of constancy that will keep her faithful to
someone who is helpless and cannot appreciate it. She
may be a too superior person for me. That is the end of
it. I shall never mention her again. You have been
very good to find so many excuses for her, and to keep
alive my regard. But I cannot afford to lose your friendship.
Carrington won't grudge me that, I know."
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline smiled. She was rather proud that he asked
her friendship.
</p>

<p>
There were belles who were eager to gain his attention.
Jaqueline resolved to keep the best of her friend to herself,
and smiled a little at the curiously obedient manner
in which he returned to her when she had sent him to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_171' name='Page_171'>[171]</a></span>
dance with someone. She liked the pretty ordering about
of her admirers, the sense of power at once fascinating
and dangerous.
</p>

<p>
"I shall try to get off for a few days and pay you a
visit," Ralston said. "Louis will be going back to college,
and next year we shall have him in Washington.
And you will be up often this winter? Mrs. Jettson
seems deserted by both of her sisters. She is so fond
of young people."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes; I shall be up a good deal."
</p>

<p>
"And the visit?" tentatively.
</p>

<p>
"We shall be delighted to see you. You will have an
admiring audience from father down."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you. You can never know what a comfort
you have been to me. And these few days have quite
restored me to myself. Have I been a very foolish, love-stricken
swain?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I do not think you have been foolish at all! I
was afraid you would grow hard and cynical, and I don't
like people who are classing everybody in the same category
and looking on the worst side."
</p>

<p>
She was very young, but she had a charm that touched
his heart. Did he half envy Roger Carrington? But,
then, he would be madly jealous of anyone who lavished
her smiles in that fashion. One or two choice friends
might be admissible. He was safe, for he would never
be so easily caught again by any woman. Friendship
was all he desired, and in the years to come she would resemble
Mrs. Jettson, no doubt, who was very proud of her
husband, and fond of him too. He liked women who
were proud of their husbands. For wifely devotion had
not gone out of fashion.
</p>

<p>
There was a gay and busy autumn for Jaqueline.
Betty Fairfax had a great wedding that befitted the old
mansion where she had reigned a queen for more years
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_172' name='Page_172'>[172]</a></span>
than usually fell to the lot of a handsome Virginian girl.
She had seen two younger sisters married and made much
merriment over it, and now she was going to be the wife
of the newly elected Governor of one of the more southern
States. Consequently there was a grand time all
through the county, and there were six bridesmaids to
wait upon my lady, one of them being Jaqueline.
</p>

<p>
So there was a week to be spent with Betty, Miss Elizabeth
Fairfax, as she was called now.
</p>

<p>
"And what a shame your cousin's affairs should have
come to naught!" Betty declared. "To give up a fine
young soldier, and then to have her second lover come to
grief. It is a case of the two stools, and one coming
to the floor. If I had not heard of your engagement,
Jaqueline, I should have asked him to stand with
you. If I had known him better I should have invited
him, anyhow. There are several guests coming from
Washington."
</p>

<p>
"If I had only known you cared!" cried Jaqueline.
</p>

<p>
"You see, I want to make as brave a show as possible,"
and Betty laughed. "I desire to let my liege-lord see that
I have been accustomed to the best, and a good deal of it,
so he won't consider me an ignoramus when he is inaugurated
Governor later on."
</p>

<p>
"Then let us have Mr. Ralston!" Jaqueline's eyes
were alight with eagerness and amusement. "I will
write to Mr. Carrington, and you shall inclose an invitation.
I'll send a few lines too, so that he can see it is
really meant."
</p>

<p>
"That's quite delightful of you. Maybe he will find
some balm to mend his broken heart among the pretty
girls."
</p>

<p>
"He is not heartbroken now, although he took it very
hard at first. Grandpapa was bitterly opposed to it, you
know. And Marian is in mourning and goes nowhere,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_173' name='Page_173'>[173]</a></span>
because grandmamma thinks she ought not to be left
alone."
</p>

<p>
"But Mr. Greaves will never recover. Doctor Leets
said so."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no! No one expects it, I think."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I suppose the devotion to a lost cause looks very
pretty and constant. Only she will not be a widow,
more's the pity, for widows soon pick up husbands. Now
about the invitation."
</p>

<p>
It was so prettily worded that Lieutenant Ralston accepted
it at the first reading; and the two journeyed together
to the grand festivity. Old people and young attended,
in fashions of various kinds, from the Continental
to more modern date. The Governor of Virginia
honored Betty's nuptials, and several of the Washington
grandees. The <i>Gazette</i> had a brilliant account of it, and
it was the boast of the county for many a year afterward.
</p>

<p>
The next morning the newly wedded pair started in a
coach drawn by six white horses, ornamented with wedding
favors. And there was, as usual, much merry-making
afterwards, as there was still one daughter to lead in
the gayety.
</p>

<p>
"And when are you coming up to Georgetown?" Carrington
asked of his sweetheart.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, there is another wedding on the carpet! And
then a birthday ball at the Lees'. Then Patty is to have
a birthday celebration. She thinks thus far all the festivities
have been for me, and this time the invitations
are to go out in her name."
</p>

<p>
"And then Christmas, I suppose," in a rather disappointed
tone. "To get my share of you I shall have to
marry you, Jaqueline. Come, think about that. When
is it to be?"
</p>

<p>
"In a year. That will give me time to fulfill my engagements
and get ready."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_174' name='Page_174'>[174]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"A year!" in dismay.
</p>

<p>
"You ought not grudge me that when you think of the
years and years we shall have to live together."
</p>

<p>
"Shall have to!" he re-echoed.
</p>

<p>
"That I believe is customary when one is married," she
said with teasing archness. "Unless one happens to have
the Emperor of the French for a brother."
</p>

<p>
"Wifehood is a woman's highest prerogative&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Not to be entered into hastily or unadvisedly," she interrupted
with a mischievous smile.
</p>

<p>
She was a pretty, fascinating torment! His mother
had said: "One wedding follows another among the
bridesmaids. I hope you will come home with your day
set."
</p>

<p>
"I am going to learn to cook and to keep house this
winter," she began gravely. "And it takes a long time
to make wedding clothes."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense! There are cooks enough in the world.
As for housekeeping, that is a woman's birthright. And
at first you know we need not keep house. You will be in
Washington with me, and then we can go over home&mdash;for
I shall hardly let you out of my sight. Yes, let it be
soon after Christmas."
</p>

<p>
"I can't be hurried in that fashion," she returned petulantly.
"And I should get tired of you if you were such
a jailer as never to let me out of your sight."
</p>

<p>
"You do not love me as I love you!"
</p>

<p>
"But you know I told you I was not quite sure I loved
you enough. Love grows with some people, and with
some it comes in a moment of time. Would you not
rather have it grow year after year, and get richer and
truer&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Her voice fell to an exquisite softness, and touched him
deeply.
</p>

<p>
"There can be only one truth to love," he said solemnly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_175' name='Page_175'>[175]</a></span>
Then he took her in his arms and pressed a kiss upon her
forehead in a reverent manner.
</p>

<p>
"I must go away and leave you here," he said presently.
"I am always leaving you to some scene of
gayety."
</p>

<p>
"But you take the two most tempting young men,
the lieutenant and Dr. Collaston. Why, he will add
quite a grace and interest to Washington. And the
goodly company will be scattered, leaving behind the old
people, who are always talking of their young days. I
promised Betty I would stay a whole week with her sister.
There&mdash;I think they are calling you."
</p>

<p>
"Carriage ready, sah. Jes' time to meet de stage,"
said the black servant, who still wore his wedding favor
proudly.
</p>

<p>
Were most girls reluctant to marry? Roger Carrington
wondered. Miss Fairfax had gone away joyfully.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">LOVERS AND LOVERS.</span>
</h2>

<p>
Jaqueline found herself very much engrossed.
</p>

<p>
There was another young lady to attract visitors, and
Patricia soon became a favorite. She was vivacious and
ready to take her part in any amusement, could dance like
a fairy, and sing like a bird.
</p>

<p>
"You'll have to look to your laurels, Miss Jaqueline,"
said old Mr. Manners, their next neighbor. "Patty will
carry off all the lovers in no time. I hope you have made
sure of yours."
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline blushed and tossed her head.
</p>

<p>
"He would marry me to-morrow," she returned.
"I'm in no haste to be married."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_176' name='Page_176'>[176]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
At the next wedding she had another attendant, the
brother of the bride. Roger was too busy to come for the
mere pleasure. When the birthday ball was at the Lees'
Mr. Monroe had sent him to Philadelphia on some important
business. So Lieutenant Ralston was cavalier
for both girls; and certainly Patty was one of the belles
of the evening, and could have danced with two partners
every time.
</p>

<p>
After that came Patty's birthday, and a grand affair it
was. Mrs. Jettson ran down to look on and help a little,
as she said, but not to take an active part. Ralston
begged that Dr. Collaston might be invited. He had
graduated from the Philadelphia school, but was a Marylander
by birth; and, having a private fortune, had decided
to spend the winter in Washington. A bright, fine-looking
young fellow who played the flute delightfully
and sang all the songs of the day, and, what was of still
more importance to social life, could dance with zest and
elegance.
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline was in some degree the hostess, and distributed
her favors impartially, so Roger had very little
of her. Varina and Annis felt as if they were in fairyland,
and were entranced with delight.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Jettson insisted that after Christmas she should
have her turn with the girls.
</p>

<p>
"There are to be some famous visitors, I hear, and
Washington is getting to be quite a notable place. Not
quite St. James; but Mrs. Madison is our queen, and it is
like a little court, as Philadelphia used to be in Mrs.
Washington's time. The debates will be worth hearing,
or rather seeing, for the famous speakers who will take
part. Dolly writes about Mr. Calhoun, and there is a Mr.
Henry Clay, who is very eloquent. I can't give regular
parties, but you girls can go out, and Patty must attend
a levee and be presented to Mrs. Madison."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_177' name='Page_177'>[177]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Patricia was very much elated.
</p>

<p>
"Why, it will be something like the English stories,"&mdash;there
were a few novels even then that girls were allowed
to read,&mdash;"going up to London or to Bath with a trunk
full of finery. I don't suppose you ever will take us to
London, papa?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm getting too old. You will have to get a husband
to take you to London."
</p>

<p>
"'Where the streets were so wide and the lanes were
so narrow?'" sang Patty. "But I won't have a wheelbarrow.
I'll have a coach, or nothing."
</p>

<p>
"I wish you were not going away," Annis sighed.
"It's so bright and merry when you are here, and so
many ladies come in their pretty frocks, and they laugh
and talk. I can hear you upstairs when I am in my bed.
And the fiddles sound so gay, and then I know you are
dancing. Oh, I wish Christmas and birthdays could
come oftener!"
</p>

<p>
"The birthdays might do for little people who are anxious
to grow old fast," said Jaqueline, patting the child's
shoulder. "But the rest of us wouldn't want two or
three in a year. And it won't be very long before you'll
be going to Washington to see the queen, pussy cat."
</p>

<p>
"But I want you, not the queen. It will be so lonesome
when you are gone!"
</p>

<p>
"You are a little sweet!" Jaqueline bent over and
kissed her. "I hope you'll stay just sweet, nothing
else. Everybody will love you."
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid I don't want quite everybody," she returned
in a hesitating tone.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, one can even have too much of love," laughed
the elder sister. She thought she sometimes had too much
of it. She was proud of Roger Carrington, and she was
quite sure she did not care for anyone else in the way of
wishing that some other person stood in his place. Why,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_178' name='Page_178'>[178]</a></span>
then, was she not ready to step into his life and make it
glad with a supreme touch of happiness?
</p>

<p>
Annis glanced up wistfully to the beautiful face bent
over her, which was more engrossed with its own perplexities
than considering her little sister. Then suddenly
she laughed, a low musical sound with much
amusement in it, and Annis smiled too.
</p>

<p>
"You are having love troubles early, Annis dear," she
said gayly. Charles' <i>penchant</i> increased rather than diminished,
and Annis found it somewhat exacting and
troublesome. When there were other young visitors
Varina appropriated them, much to Charles' satisfaction,
and he invariably turned the cold shoulder to other little
girls.
</p>

<p>
"But Charles is going to school presently, and he will
get interested in boys and plans for the future, so you
may stand a chance of being forgotten; how will you
like that?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, I shall have mamma always. Jaqueline,"
hesitatingly, "does anyone love you too much? Is
it Mr. Ralston? And doesn't he love Marian any
more?"
</p>

<p>
"My dear, when Marian was engaged Mr. Ralston
gave her up, which was right and honorable. Little girls
can't understand all about such matters."
</p>

<p>
"I like Mr. Ralston very much," Annis remarked
gravely. "Varina thinks Patty will marry him."
</p>

<p>
"What nonsense! Varina is quite too ready with her
tongue. Come, don't you want a little ride with me before
I go to town?"
</p>

<p>
The child was delighted, and ran off for her hat and
coat.
</p>

<p>
Her father had suggested a little caution in regard to
Mr. Ralston. They were simply friends. He had
never uttered a word that could be wrongly construed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_179' name='Page_179'>[179]</a></span>
She had a kind of safe feeling with him. Was
there any real danger? But he was Roger's friend as
well?
</p>

<p>
There were already some invitations awaiting the
two girls when they arrived at Mrs. Jettson's. Patricia
was much elated with her first levee. Certainly there was
a group of distinguished women entertaining&mdash;Mrs. Cutts
and Mrs. Lucy Washington, now a charming young
widow; Mrs Gallatin, and the still handsome Mrs. Monroe,
who had been an acknowledged New York beauty;
and among the men the very agreeable young Washington
Irving, who was to leave a lasting mark on American
literature.
</p>

<p>
"But you feel almost afraid of the wisdom and genius
and power," said Patricia to Dr. Collaston. "Now,
there is Mr. Clay, with his sharp eyes under the overhanging
eyebrows that look as if they might dart out at you
and somehow set you in a blaze. I am to go hear one of
his speeches, my brother insists. And my cousin Dolly
is wild about Mr. Calhoun. Don't you think they might
both have been made handsomer without any great detriment
to the world? And Mrs. Calhoun is charming.
She knew some of the Floyds and heard about Dolly's
marriage."
</p>

<p>
"Patrick Henry wasn't a handsome man, if accounts
are reliable. Genius and good looks do not always go
together," and Collaston smiled.
</p>

<p>
"There is Mr. Irving. He talks delightfully. And
it is a pleasure to look at him."
</p>

<p>
"Call no man happy until he is dead. I mean it is
not safe to predict how much fame one will win until&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Until he has won it. But it is a kind of cruel thing
to wait until you are dead, when you can't know anything
about it. I mean to take my delight as I go along. But,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_180' name='Page_180'>[180]</a></span>
then, women are not expected to be addicted to longing
for fame."
</p>

<p>
"Still they may be famous for beauty. I think there
have been a number of famous women. Queen Elizabeth&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't instance the Empress Catherine nor Catherine
de Medicis. If you do, I shall never forgive you. Nor
Joan of Arc&mdash;I can't remember any more."
</p>

<p>
"Nor the Pilgrim mothers! They deserved a good
deal of credit to set up housekeeping on bleak Plymouth
Rock. Why doesn't someone talk about them! Housekeeping
is a womanly grace or virtue or acquirement&mdash;which
do you call it?"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose it is an acquirement when you work hard to
obtain it, a grace when it comes natural. Do you imagine
they kindled the fire on the rocks and boiled the kettle
as we do when we go off in the woods for a day's
pleasure?"
</p>

<p>
"They wouldn't let you do it now. Plymouth Rock has
become&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The palladium of liberty! Isn't that rather choice
and fit and elegant? It is a pity that I can't take the
credit of inventing it. And what a shame we haven't a
few rocks about here! I have a dreadful feeling that the
Capital may sink down in the slough some day and disappear.
Every street ends in a marsh."
</p>

<p>
"You see, this is rightly called the New World&mdash;it is
not finished yet."
</p>

<p>
"Dr. Collaston, we can't allow you to monopolize
the beauties of the evening. Here are some guests
anxious to meet Miss Mason," and thereupon Patricia
was turned slightly around to face a group of young
people.
</p>

<p>
But it was not all gayety or compliments, though men
were gallant enough then, and ready with florid encomiums.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_181' name='Page_181'>[181]</a></span>
There was the dreaded topic of war, which
was touched upon with bated breath; there were muttered
anathemas concerning the impressment of sailors;
there were fears of France and a misgiving that we were
not strong enough to cope with England while our resources
were still slender. And already there were undercurrents
forming for the Presidential election more
than six months hence.
</p>

<p>
But the younger people chatted nonsense, laughed at
trifles, and made engagements for pleasure as well as for
life; or the more coquettish ones teased their lovers with
vain pretenses. Mrs. Van Ness entertained with ease
and brilliance, and was as fond of gathering the younger
people about her as those more serious companies where
the responsible party men met and in a veiled way touched
upon the graver questions. At Mrs. Gallatin's one met
the more intellectual or scientific people. There was a
feeling in the air that the country ought to consider an
advancement in literature. Boston was already pluming
herself upon a certain intellectual standing. There were
Harvard and a Law Club, and a kind of literary center
that had issued a magazine, and there were several papers.
New York had some poets, and there had been a
few novels written. But what could anyone say about
such a new country? There were no famous ruins,
though there were battlefields that were to be historic
ground when men could look at them from a distance.
Many a brave story lurked in the fastnesses of Virginia,
and old James River held a romance in almost every curve
of its banks.
</p>

<p>
But people were busy about the currency and the debts,
and the laws the young nation must have for her safety,
and the respect she must demand from other nations.
For this is one of the things nations give grudgingly;
perhaps individuals do it, as well. Even now Mr.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_182' name='Page_182'>[182]</a></span>
Adams' administration was criticised, and Mr. Benjamin
Franklin was accused of spending his time flirting with
French women, who were great flatterers, all the world
knew. And some people were still berating the Jefferson
policy, and sneered at little Jemmy Madison. Washington
had not really taken hold of the hearts of the people.
Gouverneur Morris had said wittily that "it only lacked
cellars and houses and decently paved streets and a steady
population, and that it was a fine city for future residences."
</p>

<p>
Georgetown was more settled and prosperous, and
there was much going back and forth, if coaches did now
and then get stuck in the mud; and young gentlemen not
infrequently adopted the Philadelphia custom of drawing
on long leggings when they went on horseback to keep
their handsome stockings and their velvet smallclothes
from being injured.
</p>

<p>
The South was well represented in these early days.
Newspaper letters found their way to other cities, with
enthusiastic descriptions of the principal beauties, their
charms and fascinations. Mrs. Madison and her two
sisters perhaps set the pace for delightful hospitality, and
that still more engaging and agreeable quality of giving
guests a pleasant time and a lasting remembrance to take
away with them.
</p>

<p>
But it was not all pleasure. There were housewifely
duties; and more than one visitor saw the first lady of the
land in her morning gown of gray stuff and a big white
apron, for servants were not always equal to the state
dinners. There were some charities too, when the
younger people met to sew, and gossip about new fashions
and new admirers. And the first real work of benevolence
was undertaken about that time by some of the
more notable women. This was the City Orphan Asylum,
for already there were homeless waifs at the Capital.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_183' name='Page_183'>[183]</a></span>
They met once a week to cut out clothing, or cut over
garments sent in. Mrs. Van Ness kept up her interest
in it through a long life, after Mrs. Madison retired to her
Virginian home to nurse her husband's invalid mother,
and finally devote herself to the years of dependence that
befell the husband of her love. Certainly the record of
her later life reads like a charming romance. But the
young people were not interested in policies, and could
not believe in war, except Indian skirmishes and among
the European nations hungering for power.
</p>

<p>
Patricia was eager for fun and delight, and dearly
loved a dance. And, like more modern girls, she had a
desire to be settled in life, to have a home of her own. To
her that seemed the chief business to be undertaken
through these early years. She liked Ralph Carrington
very much. "But perhaps one in a family ought to suffice,"
she remarked to Jane. "Then he is so grave and
bookish, and his wife will be expected to come home. I
dare say Jack and I would always dispute about husbands.
Ralph has the best temper. Roger is dreadfully jealous.
I can't see how Jack dares to go on so."
</p>

<p>
"She'll go too far some day," and Jane gave her head
a slow, ominous shake. "And she'll be very foolish!
You mark my words, Roger Carrington will be sent
abroad before he dies of old age. It's a great honor, I
suppose, but I'd rather go on living here."
</p>

<p>
"I really don't think I'll take Ralph," after some consideration.
"Do you suppose this gold-thread embroidery
will look like that imported stuff?" holding up
her work, as if that was more important.
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's pretty enough for a queen. There's that
New York judge, Patty&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I'd rather have someone first-hand. I can't take another
woman's children to my palpitating bosom and have
it palpitate as sweetly as Marian's did. But, la! there's a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_184' name='Page_184'>[184]</a></span>
talk that Mrs. Washington smiles on Judge Todd, who is
her shadow! But he's in the Supreme Court."
</p>

<p>
"And ever so much older."
</p>

<p>
"Well, so was Mr. Madison."
</p>

<p>
"I like young men best."
</p>

<p>
"Peyton Lee is over here half his time."
</p>

<p>
"But, then, I've known him always. And he is too
easy. Why, I could run right over him! Because a
man cares for a girl he shouldn't be wishy-washy," and
Patty tossed her dainty head.
</p>

<p>
Jane laughed. "And the doctor?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I dare say he will want to go back to Philadelphia
and turn Quaker. I couldn't wear those hideous
straight gowns and horrid scoop hats without a bow!"
</p>

<p>
"He has been investing in Washington property. He
talks of building several houses to rent for the winter. It
would be quite a scheme, if they were furnished. Senator
Macy would have brought his family if he could have
found a comfortable place for them to live. There ought
to be some decent hotels and boarding-houses. Men can
manage to squeeze in, but it gives permanency to a city
to have homes and wives and children. And Washington
is kind of shifty. Look how prosperous Georgetown
is!"
</p>

<p>
Patty nodded. The doctor had discussed this property
scheme with her. She was seriously considering him in
her own mind. He had not quite asked her to marry
him, but he was keeping a very watchful eye over
her.
</p>

<p>
They went up to Arlington for a three-days' visit and a
dance. There was a week at Bladensburg and a sleigh-ride,
a rather infrequent occurrence, which made no end
of fun and frolic. By this time the doctor had laid his
case before Mr. Mason. He had decided to cast in his
lot with the new city, to set up a home, and desired permission
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_185' name='Page_185'>[185]</a></span>
to address charming Miss Patricia on the subject.
He presented his worldly prospects to the elder gentleman
in a very frank manner, and referred him to some
well-known residents of the Quaker City.
</p>

<p>
Patty had been engrossed a good deal with her own affairs,
although she had laughed and danced with the gayest.
Jane had been much interested in watching the outcome
of the adventure. She had an elder-sisterly feeling
for these girls, who had been so much nearer since
Marian's defection. She should be rather proud of their
both doing so well under her supervision.
</p>

<p>
So Jaqueline had been going her own gait pretty well,
and developed an inordinate fondness for pleasure and
flattery. She was too wise to believe all the pretty
speeches, all the earnest speeches even. But they had a
rosy fragrance, and perhaps the good thing about some
of them was that they faded. She was not an inborn coquette,
hungry for lasting power over men's hearts, but
the present moment satisfied her. The variety fascinated
her.
</p>

<p>
Roger Carrington, watching this, was at first rather
amused, then a little hurt, and finally, when he began to
ask himself seriously how much true regard Jaqueline
had for him, grew passionately jealous. If she had said,
"I have made a sad mistake; I find that I have a deeper
regard for Lieutenant Ralston than I imagined; will you
give me back my freedom?" he would have been manly
to the heart's core, and released her, though it had
wrenched away the beautiful dream of his life.
</p>

<p>
But she affected to treat this merely as a friendship.
Could she not see?
</p>

<p>
When other attentions became troublesome she sheltered
herself behind Ralston. He was engrossed in the
affairs of the country. He had a feeling at times that he
was only playing a part in life, that instead of being merely
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_186' name='Page_186'>[186]</a></span>
an ornamental soldier he should go out on the frontier and
take an active part in the struggles. He was not meant
for a statesman, though he listened, fascinated, to Marshall
and Randolph and Clay and Calhoun, and envied
them their power of moving the multitude. Then, it did
not seem very heroic to be getting the level of a street and
calculating the filling in, to consider Tiber Creek and
Darby Marsh, to superintend rows of trees and dikes and
blind ditches. But when he confessed his dissatisfactions
to Jaqueline, she said with a wise, earnest, sisterly air:
"Oh, do not go away! There will be an election in the
coming autumn, and how do you know but we may be
plunged into war and need you for our own defense?
Arthur thinks so much of your advice and counsel."
</p>

<p>
That was very true. The thing was to build up Washington.
Other cities had grown by slow accretion, and
been a hundred and more years about it. Congress had
ordered a city on a slender purse. There had been magnificent
plans and a half-finished Capitol, a Presidential
residence that Mrs. Adams had not inaptly termed a
"great castle"; there were scattered beautiful houses,
and though more than a dozen years had passed it was not
yet a city of homes; but there was a new <i>amour propre</i>
awakening. The poverty of those days can scarcely be
understood in these times of lavishness.
</p>

<p>
So energetic young men like Arthur Jettson and Dr.
Collaston found scope for all their energies, and were
warmly welcomed.
</p>

<p>
The latter had hardly decided where to make his home
until he met Patricia Mason. And now he adopted his
nation's Capital at once.
</p>

<p>
His answer was favorable, and he hurried to his sweetheart
with all impatience, though he had been cool enough
before. And she accepted him, as any sensible girl with
a strong liking for a young man every way worthy of her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_187' name='Page_187'>[187]</a></span>
regard was likely to do. Jane was called in presently to
rejoice with them.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Patty!" she exclaimed afterward, kissing her enthusiastically,
"it's just a splendid marriage! I'm so
glad to keep you in Washington! You and Jaqueline
and I will have such good times&mdash;we think alike on so
many subjects. I am happy for you, my dear. And I do
wonder if you'll want to spin out your engagement&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"He won't," returned Patty, her pretty face red as a
rose, and her eyes suffused with a kind of prideful love.
"Why, he spoke of it and thought a month would do!
The idea! And all the wedding clothes to get and make!
And he never once suggested that we should go to New
York, as Preston Floyd did!"
</p>

<p>
Patty drew her face in comical lines, as if indicating
disappointment; but the laugh spoiled it all, and the
waves of joy dancing in the lines were fascinating.
</p>

<p>
"I do wonder what grandmamma will give me? The
pearls and the rubies are bespoke, and she has a diamond
cross that has been in the family&mdash;how long?"
</p>

<p>
"And the diamond ring father Mason gave her. You
know Aunt Catharine claims that. I ought to have the
cross, being the oldest girl, though it did come from the
Verney side."
</p>

<p>
"Jaqueline is to have our own mother's pearls.
There's a beautiful string of them, and eardrops. But
I think the doctor has some diamonds belonging to his
mother. Oh, I wish there were some brothers and sisters!
I shall not gain any new relations! Father wrote
him a delightful letter; I wish I had kept it to show you.
And he says Jaqueline and I must come home soon. Perhaps
he will be up next week."
</p>

<p>
So they chatted, and when Mr. Jettson came in to
dinner it was all gone over again. If girls did not exactly
"thank Heaven fasting" for a good husband, they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_188' name='Page_188'>[188]</a></span>
were glad and proud of their great success. They were
not ashamed of loving and being loved; there was a kind
of sacredness to most women about this best gift of life.
For in those days it was for life. If it did not begin with
the maddening fervor of some later loves, it kept gathering
sweetness as the years went on.
</p>

<p>
Patty was still at her needlework when Mr. Carrington
came in.
</p>

<p>
"Mother has just sent a servant over to say that I am
to bring you and Jaqueline to tea and to spend the night.
Some Baltimore relatives have come, and she is anxious
you shall meet. They go to Alexandria to-morrow, and
then to Stafford, which accounts for the short notice."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Jaqueline went over to the Bradfords' this morning.
They're going to have a little play, and want her
to take part. She can do that so splendidly, you know.
Lieutenant Ralston came for her, and said she was to stay
to dinner."
</p>

<p>
Carrington frowned and bit his lip.
</p>

<p>
"I think I'll send over to the Bradfords'. I can't go
myself," as if he were considering.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry, Roger, but perhaps <i>I</i> ought not go. And
I hate to disappoint your mother when she has been so
kind to us. But Dr. Collaston is coming in this evening&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
There was a flood of scarlet leaping to her face as she
gave a half-embarrassed laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Patty! you don't mean&mdash;I mistrusted he was in
love with you, but it doesn't always follow that a girl is
in love. Shall I give you my best, my most heartfelt
wishes? For I know your father will approve. He is a
fine fellow, and a fortune is no detriment."
</p>

<p>
He took her hand in a tender clasp and then pressed it
to his lips.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, the approval was sought beforehand. He heard
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_189' name='Page_189'>[189]</a></span>
from papa this morning, and came at once. And I'm
not good at secrets," with a joyous laugh.
</p>

<p>
"And you are very happy? I need not ask it of such
eyes as those." Their great gladness gave him a pang.
</p>

<p>
"It was so sudden. You see, I wasn't quite sure," the
color fluttering up and down her sweet face. "I kept
saying to myself, 'There are plenty of others,' and now I
know there was just one, and I could never be so glad
about any other. I am a silly girl, am I not, but you are
almost a brother&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I wish I were quite, in the way that marriage gives
you a brother. I shall shake hands most cordially with
the doctor. Perhaps we might go as a party&mdash;would you
mind?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no! If you could find Jaqueline."
</p>

<p>
"I'll see at once, and send you word. And get word
to the doctor also."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, thank you!"
</p>

<p>
Roger Carrington dispatched a messenger to the Bradfords.
The party had just gone to Mount Pleasant on
horseback. It was doubtful if they would be home before
supper. They were not sure, and there was a beautiful
full moon.
</p>

<p>
Then Carrington was angry. She thought nothing of
going off with Ralston, and she might at least have consulted
him about the play. That she had not known of it
last evening did not at that moment occur to him. All the
grievances and irritations of the past few weeks suddenly
accumulated, accentuated by the joyous face he had left
behind. Did Jaqueline really love him? Had she not put
off the marriage on one pretext and another? She had
taken admiration very freely, quite as if she were not an
engaged girl. It had annoyed him, but he did not want
to play the tyrant, and she had so many pretty excuses.
How sweet and coaxing the tones of her voice were!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_190' name='Page_190'>[190]</a></span>
Her smiling eyes had ever persuaded him; and when tears
gathered in them they were irresistible and swept away
judgment. He had been too easy. After all, a man was
to be the head.
</p>

<p>
He did not find the doctor either, but sent word to Patricia
that he was most sorry to take such a disappointment
to his mother. They would all go some other time.
And he went home rather out of temper inwardly, but
courteous to his mother's guests outwardly.
</p>

<p>
They were quite disappointed at not seeing Roger's
betrothed.
</p>

<p>
All the next day and evening he was so closely engaged
that he could not even run down to the Jettsons'
until after nine; and then they were all out. That did
not improve the white heat of his indignation, and convinced
him that Jaqueline cared more for her own pleasure
than for him. Then when he called the day following
she was over at the Bradfords' practicing.
</p>

<p>
"It's too bad!" cried Patricia. "They never came
home from their ride until after ten. Jaqueline looked
for you yesterday. The play is to be on Monday night,
and father is coming up on Wednesday, though now
Jaqueline is in it she will have to stay. It is to be quite
an event. And a dance afterward."
</p>

<p>
Occasionally a theatrical company strayed into Washington,
but private plays were a treat to the actors as well
as to the invited guests. The Bradfords' house was commodious,
and the tickets were to be sold for the benefit of
the orphan asylum, so there was no difficulty in disposing
of them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_191' name='Page_191'>[191]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">JAQUELINE.</span>
</h2>

<p>
"I thought I should never see you again."
</p>

<p>
It was almost dusk of the short day, as it had been
cloudy and was threatening a storm. Roger had overtaken
Jaqueline on her homeward way.
</p>

<p>
"How many days has it been?" turning a smiling face
to him. "I have sold all my tickets, and I had meant to
keep two for you. Come home to supper with me. Of
course you know what has happened! Patty acts as if
no girl ever had a lover before. It is amusing."
</p>

<p>
Her light tone angered him.
</p>

<p>
"Walk a little ways with me. I have something to
say to you."
</p>

<p>
He drew her hand through his arm and strode on.
She braced herself for a storm.
</p>

<p>
"What&mdash;down to the marsh? The frost is coming out
of the ground, and we shall be swamped."
</p>

<p>
That was true enough. He turned suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"Let us go home. It looks like rain. I believe I felt
a drop on my face," she began.
</p>

<p>
"Not until I have said my say," in a resolute tone of
voice. "Jaqueline, I cannot have this manner of going
on. It is very unjust to me, and you will not be the
more respected by parading Lieutenant Ralston's devotion
to you when you have an acknowledged lover."
</p>

<p>
"His devotion to me? Why, everybody knows&mdash;at
least, we all know&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"That figment is only a cover for flirting."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;he is your friend." Her tone was quite resentful,
and her temper was rising.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Was!</i>" with emphasis. "But this shall no longer
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_192' name='Page_192'>[192]</a></span>
be a cover for you. You choose between us. If you
like him so much better&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Roger, he has never uttered a word of love to me."
She stopped short in indignation.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no! He has some lingering remnant of honor.
But you will see how soon he will ask you to marry him
when I have given you up."
</p>

<p>
Given her up! There was a white line about her
mouth, and her eyes seemed to hold the depth of midnight.
</p>

<p>
He had not meant to utter the words, though they had
been in his mind for days. At the first inception of such
a suspicion he had said he would never give her her liberty
and see her married to another man, and then as he
had seen her dispensing her smiles to a group of young
men and bending her dainty head first to one and then to
another, as if what the present speaker was saying was
of the utmost moment, a curious revulsion of feeling
swept over him. Yes, let Ralston take her, with all her
love for the admiration of everybody! Perhaps he did
not care for one supreme love.
</p>

<p>
She was silent from sheer amazement. That any man
who was her real lover should talk of such a possibility
stung her to the quick.
</p>

<p>
"Jaqueline, I cannot go on this way," and his voice
dropped to a softer key. "I want all the tenderness of
the woman I love, and some of the attention, I must confess.
If she cares for me I do not see how she can be
continually occupied with others. You give me just the
fragments. You make engagements, you go out without
the least thought that I might have something in view;
you have put off our marriage from time to time, and
now you must decide. If you love me well enough to
marry me&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Out of hand!" She gave a scornful little laugh. "I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_193' name='Page_193'>[193]</a></span>
thought it was a girl's prerogative to appoint her own
wedding-day. I will not be hurried and ordered about
as if I had no mind of my own. I will be no one's slave!
I will not be watched and suspected and lectured, and
shut up for fear someone will see me!"
</p>

<p>
"Jaqueline!"
</p>

<p>
She was very angry now, and it seemed to her as if
she had a curiously clear conscience. She had not expected
to stay at the Bradfords' until just after dinner,
but there were still some points to settle, then someone
proposed the ride. Ralston had not remained to dinner,
and had not gone out to Mount Pleasant with them, but
a servant had been sent in with several invitations for
gentlemen. Impromptu parties were of no infrequent
occurrence among young people. Jaqueline did not
know of the invitations until after the messenger had been
sent; and from some oversight no one had mentioned Mr.
Carrington.
</p>

<p>
She could have explained this. But when she glanced
at the erect figure, the steady eyes, the set lip, he looked
so masterful. She was used to her father's easy-going
ways, and Ralston's persistence in the matter of Marian
had a heroic aspect to her. If Roger was so arbitrary beforehand,
what would he be as a husband! She forgot
how many times she had persuaded him from the very
desire of his heart.
</p>

<p>
"It is just this, Jaqueline&mdash;I am tired of trifling. If
you do not care to marry me, say so. I sometimes think
you do not, that you care for lovers only, admirers who
hover about continually, glad of a crumb from a pretty
girl. I am not one of them. You take me and let my
attentions suffice, or you leave me&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She had an ideal of what a lover should be, and he
looked most unlike it in this determined mood. Why, he
was almost as arbitrary as grandfather!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_194' name='Page_194'>[194]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Suppose I do not care to be hurried by a fit of anger
on your part? If you had asked an explanation like a
gentleman&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I do not want explanations. You take me or leave
me. I have danced attendance on you long enough to
no purpose."
</p>

<p>
"I certainly shall not take you in this dreadful temper!"
</p>

<p>
"Very well." He turned slowly. If he really cared
for her he would not go. She stood dignified and
haughty. Of course he would come around, for if he
truly loved her he could not face the future without her.
But the door shut between them.
</p>

<p>
It was very ungenerous for him to be jealous of Ralston,
and foolish of him not to like her part in the little
play. She was not the heroine who had two lovers adoring
her, but a pretty maid who had made her election and
was pestered by someone she did not care for, and the
story turned on her quick wit in extricating her mistress
from a dilemma. Ralston was the lover to whom her sympathies
went, and the one her mistress secretly favored.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Carrington came over that day to take the girls
out for a drive and to try to persuade them to come over
for a Sunday visit. She congratulated Patricia warmly
on her prospects.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps we shall have a double wedding," with a
soft, motherly smile.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't plan for that!" ejaculated the elder girl
with a shiver. "Grandmamma did, you know, and such
misfortunes happened."
</p>

<p>
"But it would be lovely!" Patricia exclaimed longingly,
wondering at her sister's vehemence.
</p>

<p>
"And you think you cannot come?" Mrs. Carrington
said as they drove back to Mrs. Jettson's. "It would be
such a great pleasure to us all!"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_195' name='Page_195'>[195]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"We have a Saturday-night engagement at the Hamiltons',"
Patricia replied. "And Sunday there are to be
some guests to dinner."
</p>

<p>
"And the play Monday evening," added Jaqueline in
a voice she tried to keep steady.
</p>

<p>
"I don't wonder you two girls have delightful times
and are full of engagements," said the elder woman with
a smile of admiration. "But my turn will come presently.
Good-by, my dears."
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline felt confident she should meet her lover at the
Hamiltons', but she did not. Sunday passed without him.
</p>

<p>
"Whatever is the matter?" inquired Patty.
</p>

<p>
"A little lovers' tiff," and Jaqueline gave an airy toss
of the head, with a rather disdainful smile.
</p>

<p>
"You never do mean to quarrel with Roger Carrington!"
exclaimed Patty in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"It was of his own making."
</p>

<p>
"Jack, now that I have a lover of my very own, I don't
see how you can be so fond of&mdash;of other men. You
haven't treated Roger at all well."
</p>

<p>
"I won't be called that detestable <i>Jack</i>! And I am not
man-crazy!"
</p>

<p>
"No, they are crazy about you. I shouldn't think
Roger would like it. No lover would stand it."
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline made no reply.
</p>

<p>
Monday there was a rehearsal, and Jaqueline remained
to tea. There was a very enthusiastic audience, and the
play was charmingly acted. Of course Roger was there,
and chatted with Patricia and the doctor. Jaqueline in
her heart acted for him alone. She was so eager and
interested in furthering Margaret Bradford's love for
Lieutenant Ralston that she thought he must see how
frankly and freely she could relinquish him. But Roger,
knowing that Margaret Bradford had a real lover, looked
at it from a different point of view.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_196' name='Page_196'>[196]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Will you give my congratulations to your sister?"
he said to Patricia, rising, as the curtain fell for the last
time. "There is some important business at Mr. Monroe's,
and I am to be there at ten."
</p>

<p>
"Are you not going to stay to the supper?" Patty cried
in surprise. "I know Jaqueline expects you."
</p>

<p>
If she had sent ever such a little note to bid him come!
But she had made no sign.
</p>

<p>
Then Jaqueline Mason was very angry. She would
not believe any man actually in love could so hold aloof.
It was an insult! And while her passion was at white
heat the next morning she penned a sharp note of dismissal.
He should not plume himself upon having given
her up.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Mason came to Washington according to agreement,
and was very well satisfied with his prospective
son-in-law.
</p>

<p>
"But do not go on too fast," he advised. "Matters
look squally ahead. And if we should have
war&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It will hardly invade us, when there are more important
cities open to attack. And I cannot really think it.
As the capital of the nation we must plan and build for
the future. L'Enfant planned magnificently; it is for us
to carry it out. And we younger men, who have not had
our tempers so tried with all the disputes, will continue it
with greater enthusiasm. It must be the grandest place
in the whole country."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Mason smiled thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"I hope it may be. We had a hard fight for it
in the beginning. I want the wisdom of our choice
apparent."
</p>

<p>
"It will be the city of my adoption, and I shall bend all
my energies, and whatever money I can spare, to its advancement.
Having won my wife here, it will always
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_197' name='Page_197'>[197]</a></span>
keep a charm for me. I should like to be married as
soon as is convenient. Patricia will be very happy here,
I am sure."
</p>

<p>
Patricia was a fortunate girl, her father thought.
Fathers had their daughters' interests at heart in those
days, when there was time to live.
</p>

<p>
"What is this?" he asked of Jaqueline on the morning
of their departure, holding a brief note before her eyes.
"You don't mean that you have dismissed Mr. Carrington?"
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline flushed deeply, then turned pale. For a moment
it seemed as if her tongue was numb with terror.
Had he really accepted her desire without a protest?
Was it her desire?
</p>

<p>
"There was&mdash;oh, I cannot tell you now! Wait until
we get home," she pleaded.
</p>

<p>
"But he says&mdash;it is your wish! Jaqueline, my child,
you never could have been so foolish as to throw over a
man like that!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, papa&mdash;don't, don't! When you hear all&mdash;"
and she clasped her arms about his neck.
</p>

<p>
"I can't imagine him doing an ungentlemanly act.
And if you have learned anything to his detriment&mdash;there
are malicious tongues, you know. Yet I cannot bear to
think you were to blame."
</p>

<p>
The girl was silent, and swallowed hard over the lump
of condemnation in her throat. For she had thought he
would offer her some opportunity to rehabilitate herself.
She could not believe she had given such bitter
offense. It seemed to her that she would have forgiven
almost anything to Roger. Suppose he had wanted to
take part in a play with a girl she had not liked? But,
then, he and Ralston had been warm friends. Roger
went to places where she was not acquainted, at the
houses of some of the senators. The Monroes invited
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_198' name='Page_198'>[198]</a></span>
him. Yes, he met some very charming women at dinners.
But she knew she held his inmost heart, as far as
other women were concerned. And why could he not
have the same trust in her?
</p>

<p>
Dr. Collaston treated it as a mere lovers' tiff. "They
will make up again," he said to Patricia. "And no doubt
we'll be married at the same time. Carrington is a fine
fellow."
</p>

<p>
For the first day Patricia's affairs occupied everybody,
to the farthest slave cabin. Big and little wanted a peep
at Miss Patty's lover. Comparisons were drawn between
him and Mr. Carrington, and a doctor was looked upon
as something rather uncanny. But he soon made himself
a favorite.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Mason was consulted about the wedding.
</p>

<p>
"What are Jaqueline's plans?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"I must get to the bottom of that matter," the father
remarked with a sigh. "Something has happened between
them."
</p>

<p>
"And we all like Roger so much."
</p>

<p>
It was a fine day in early spring, with the breath of new
growing things making the air fragrant. Jaqueline was
walking with Annis and telling over the pretty ways and
whims of the Jettson baby, and how fond the boys were
of their little sister.
</p>

<p>
"Jaqueline!" called her father.
</p>

<p>
"No, don't come with me, dear. I'll be back in a few
moments."
</p>

<p>
Annis sat down on a flat stone where a bit of trailing
moss dropped from a tree, swinging to and fro. She
amused herself trying to catch it. And then she heard a
voice raised in tones that were not pleasant.
</p>

<p>
Without exactly meaning to make it harder for her
sister, Patricia had admitted that Roger had some cause
to find fault. Jacky had been very much admired, and she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_199' name='Page_199'>[199]</a></span>
had not paid due attention to Roger. There had been
something about the play, but she didn't think Jaqueline
cared any more for Ralston than for half a dozen others.
From it all Mr. Mason gathered that his daughter had
not been blameless.
</p>

<p>
To break an engagement without excellent reasons was
considered very reprehensible. A girl might have lovers
by the score; and though she might lay herself open to
the accusation of flirting&mdash;this was easily forgiven.
But when one's word had once been passed, it was the
sacred honor of womanhood, and to break it left a stigma
not easily overcome.
</p>

<p>
To Mr. Mason, with his strict sense of justice, this
was a severe blow. He had been proud of Jaqueline going
back into the Carrington family, and her warm welcome
from both ladies. Dr. Collaston had a much larger
fortune and was of good family, but the Carringtons had
some of the proudest Maryland and Virginian blood in
their veins, heroes who had made their mark, women
both brave and beautiful. And there was no doubt but
that Roger would make some sort of a high record and
be called upon to fill an important position.
</p>

<p>
"You have been a foolish and wicked girl!" he said
angrily to his daughter. "You have disgraced yourself
and us, and broken up a lifelong friendship just to gratify
a silly vanity and a spirit of contumacy that is despicable
in a woman! I am sure Roger had some rights in the
case. If he had come to me I should have appointed a
wedding-day at once. And now you will be the laughing-stock
of the county."
</p>

<p>
That was the mortifying point. Patricia would be married
before her, with a great flourish of trumpets. She
felt almost as if she would make some effort to recall
Roger. But that brief note to her father, explaining that
he had given her her liberty because she wished it, being
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_200' name='Page_200'>[200]</a></span>
quite convinced it was better for them to separate,
seemed to cut off every avenue of promise.
</p>

<p>
"Father is awful mad at Jaqueline," said Varina to
Annis. "He's scolded her like fun! And she isn't going
to marry Roger. The slaves say when the eldest lets
her sister get married first that she will have to go and
dance in the pigpen. Do you suppose she will?"
</p>

<p>
"No, she won't!" exclaimed Annis indignantly. "And
I'm sorry. Poor Jaqueline!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you needn't be sorry! Jack can get ever
so many lovers. But I'd like them both to be married.
They're always saying, 'Run away, Rene,' or 'Go get this
and that,' when they know you can't find it. And Patty
is going to live in a beautiful big house in Washington,
ever so much bigger than Aunt Jane's, and she will give
balls and parties and go to Mrs. Madison's every day. I
mean to coax papa to let me live with her."
</p>

<p>
That was all very grand. Annis liked Dr. Collaston,
too. Patty had grown curiously sweet, and everybody
was coming to wish her happiness.
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline was evidently in disgrace. Even grandmother,
who came down to spend a few days and hear
the plans, read her a severe lecture. Mrs. Mason was
sorry, for she felt in her heart that Jaqueline cared more
for Roger than she admitted.
</p>

<p>
But the sympathy from little Annis was the sweetest.
She had a way of patting Jaqueline's hand and pressing
it to her soft cheek, of glancing up with such tender eyes
that it moved the elder's heart inexpressibly.
</p>

<p>
There was a world of excitement on the old plantation.
Madam Floyd had been married there in grand state and
dignity, but "Miss Cassy" had missed a wedding in her
youth, and now that one of the household, born under the
roof-tree and reared among them all, one of the true
"chillen at de big house," was to be wedded with a gay
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_201' name='Page_201'>[201]</a></span>
bevy of bridesmaids and an evening of dancing to bridal
music, the whole place was astir. Dr. Collaston would
wait no later than June.
</p>

<p>
"After all," declared Patty, "much of the work can
be done afterward. The house will not be finished until
August; meanwhile we shall stay wherever we can, and
spend a month at Bladensburg. So there need be no
hurry about anything but gowns." The doctor had
ordered some things abroad, for, although duties were
high and the risks great, vessels came and went in comparative
safety.
</p>

<p>
Immediately upon the adjournment of Congress Mr.
Monroe decided upon a visit to New York, ostensibly on
his wife's account, who had been the famous Miss Kortwright
of that city. Political matters were kept in the
background. It was known that there was an undercurrent
at work for De Witt Clinton as the next occupant
of the Presidential chair. Mr. Monroe determined to
visit several of the larger cities, and Roger Carrington
was glad of the opportunity to go away. Ralston had
been sent with a corps of engineers to examine the defenses
of several important points.
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline was relieved, and yet strangely disappointed.
Did Ralston know that he had been considered a sort of
marplot? Yet when Carrington went carefully over the
ground, he thought if there was any fault between them
it really was Jaqueline's appropriation of the young man.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Carrington had been deeply disappointed; but,
mother-like, she blamed Jaqueline for the trouble. The
answer to Patricia's wedding invitation had been a brief
note in which Madam and Ralph joined her in congratulations.
The elder lady was now quite an invalid,
so it would not be possible for them to leave home.
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline felt curiously bewildered in those days. At
times she decided that she really hated Roger for his jealous,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_202' name='Page_202'>[202]</a></span>
overbearing disposition, and was thankful she was
not to be his wife. Then a wave of the old love and longing
would sweep over her. Would a line from her bring
him back? But he was quite wrong about Ralston.
</p>

<p>
So there was a grand wedding, and young and old were
invited, with numerous guests from Washington. Annis
and Varina brought up the rear of the bridesmaids, with
Charles and a neighboring lad, dressed in the pretty
French-court style.
</p>

<p>
"You are more beautiful than the bride," said Charles
gallantly. "When you are married you must be dressed
just that way."
</p>

<p>
It was a summer of gayety, and there were times when
everyone allowed Jaqueline to forget her naughtiness,
and she almost forgot it herself. Louis came home
crowned with honors and very proud of his success, and
pleased Patricia by his admiration of her husband.
</p>

<p>
"How tall and pretty Annis is growing!" he said to
her mother. "But try to keep her a little girl, and let
Rene have full swing first and marry off. Though I shall
rather pity her husband, her temper is so capricious.
Annis is sweetness itself. She seems to be the peacemaker
always."
</p>

<p>
"Don't flatter her too extravagantly. I think you all
torment Varina so much that it makes her irritable."
</p>

<p>
"Varina and Charles bicker constantly. Charles must
go to school next year and get the nonsense shaken out of
him. Varina ought to try it too. There is a very excellent
girls' school at Williamsburg, and a little of Aunt
Catharine's discipline would do her good. We are a
rather lawless set, and you have been very kind to us."
</p>

<p>
"I have not found any of you troublesome," and the
stepmother smiled upon her tall son. "Charles is anxious
to go away now."
</p>

<p>
"He is a smart, queer chap, and will be a professor of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_203' name='Page_203'>[203]</a></span>
some kind. At present he is simply omnivorous; it
makes little difference what, so long as he learns. And I
really did not like to study."
</p>

<p>
"You have given your father a great deal of pleasure
by your perseverance," she said sweetly.
</p>

<p>
Varina was jealous that both brothers should haunt
Annis so continually and be so ready to plan pleasures for
her. She quite decided now that Annis might marry
Charles.
</p>

<p>
"And if no one marries me I shall go and keep house
for Louis in Washington," she announced.
</p>

<p>
There was a houseful of grown people one afternoon,
when Annis took her sewing and went down to the creek
to a shady spot the children were very fond of. Louis
had made a kind of swinging seat with a wild grapevine,
and it was a favorite haunt of hers, though when she
found Varina in it she never disturbed her or disputed her
claim. Charles often sat and read to her.
</p>

<p>
"Do, Rene, go away or find something to do!" exclaimed
Jaqueline presently, when the younger had been
especially tormenting. "You are worse than a gadfly!"
</p>

<p>
"There's no one to amuse me. I don't care for those
folks on the porch talking politics."
</p>

<p>
"Then go down to the quarters and set the darkies to
dancing or order up Hornet."
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to ride alone. It was mean in Charles
to go off without saying a word."
</p>

<p>
"Papa sent him over to the Crears' on an errand."
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't have spoiled the errand."
</p>

<p>
"I am going down to listen to the politics, and learn
who will be next President."
</p>

<p>
"Then I'll hunt up Annis."
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline hoped Annis had gone wandering in the
woods. But Varina went straight to the retreat. Yes,
there was Annis swinging in her shady nook with a very
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_204' name='Page_204'>[204]</a></span>
slow movement that did not hinder her from sewing on
her strip of gay embroidery. And Charles sat on his
horse in his delicate, high-bred manner. They all said
he resembled the old courtier in the parlor.
</p>

<p>
The little creek purled over the stones, crooning its way
along. The air was sweet with innumerable fragrances,
the sunshine veiled with a soft haze that deepened the
shadows all about. Charles enjoyed the brooding atmosphere
and the picture Annis made. His horse had taken
a few steps in the creek and quenched his thirst, and
now seemed enjoying the fine prospect.
</p>

<p>
Varina made her complaint at once.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't want you to go with me," he answered.
"Papa had nothing to do with it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you might have made me Jack at a pinch, if
Annis could not go."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't ask Annis. And I didn't want any pinches,"
laughingly.
</p>

<p>
Varina roamed up and down, interrupting the talk.
Charles had stumbled over his brother's copy of Shakspere,
that had opened a new world to him. Louis
laughed a little at his enthusiasm, but Annis never
laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I mean some day to go and see all these places,"
he was saying. "You know, they are real places,
and some of the people were real people. Perhaps
they all were. Varina, don't you splash the water over
Annis."
</p>

<p>
Varina had picked up a slender dead branch, and was
beating up waves in the little creek. The spray went
quite a distance.
</p>

<p>
"No matter," said Annis. "A little water doesn't
hurt. But tell me, did they really put out Prince Arthur's
eyes? How could they be so cruel?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't see how you can take an interest in such
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_205' name='Page_205'>[205]</a></span>
people. You're always talking about wars and all manner
of terrible things."
</p>

<p>
Varina brought her stick down with emphasis. Sam
had been stepping softly about the edge of the creek, the
cool water laving his hoofs. He had not minded the
sprinkling on his sides, but this gave him a drench in the
face. He threw up his head and turned to walk out.
Charles had dropped the bridle rein, but Sam was gentle
enough. As he reached the edge he stepped on a rolling
stone, stumbled, tried to regain his poise, but both horse
and boy went over. Sam righted himself in a moment,
but Charles lay quite still.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, if you have killed him!" cried Annis.
</p>

<p>
Varina was white with an awful fear, too much alarmed
to make a sound. It was Annis who flew to his side.
She bathed his face and head with her handkerchief.
Sam came and looked on with a human expression in his
eyes. Charles stirred and sighed.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he isn't dead!" cried Annis joyfully.
</p>

<p>
"No, I'm not dead." Charles sat up, wincing a little.
"What happened?"
</p>

<p>
Varina pushed Annis aside and knelt down with her
arms around him. "I'm so sorry!" she began. "But
that little douse didn't make Sam stumble. What can I
do? Shall I run up to the house for anything?"
</p>

<p>
"Just help me up. No, I haven't any broken bones.
Be thankful for that, Rene," and the boy tried every
limb. There were twinges in his back and a queer,
half-dizzy feeling in his head. "I'll be all right in a
moment."
</p>

<p>
Sam seemed to feel reassured, and went to cropping
the sedgy grass.
</p>

<p>
"There, don't cry, Rene. It wasn't all your fault.
Sam trod on something that rolled&mdash;a stone, I think."
</p>

<p>
"And I do love you so&mdash;ever so much more than you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_206' name='Page_206'>[206]</a></span>
love me! And it gives me a heartache to see you all
take in Annis and crowd me out."
</p>

<p>
Varina began to sob.
</p>

<p>
"I don't mean to crowd anyone out," declared Annis in
a tone that sounded as if it came over tears. "And you
all have a part of my own mamma."
</p>

<p>
"Annis is so good and sweet, and ready to give up any
point, and you want always to take things whether or no.
Perhaps you'll grow up like Jaqueline or Patty, and Patty's
awful sweet to everybody since she's had a husband.
There, don't cry any more; I'm not killed. I'll sit
here and rest a little. And, Rene, if you would only
give over tormenting people when they tell you to
stop!"
</p>

<p>
Varina was still a good deal alarmed. She could see
Charles' white face without a bit of color in the lips as
he lay on the ground. He was pale still, as he leaned
back in the swing.
</p>

<p>
"And, Rene, you will never, never get a husband unless
you do change. You'll be a cross and queer old maid,
and not one of us will be willing to have you about. And
you can be real nice."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't scold her so!" Annis went and clasped
her arms about Varina's neck. "She is going to be
sweet and good because nothing dreadful did happen.
God, you know, kept it from happening. And when one
is very grateful one tries hard to do one's best. Sometimes
I think you don't love Rene enough, and it makes
her hurt and sore."
</p>

<p>
Then the children made resolves all around, and
Charles walked between the girls up to the house. If
the making up could only last!
</p>

<p>
"Don't say a word about it," he cautioned them.
"Father would make a fuss." Then he turned and kissed
Varina, a caress he seldom offered her.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_207' name='Page_207'>[207]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to try, I really am. But it is so hard not
to be loved."
</p>

<p>
"But we do love you," declared both in a breath.
</p>

<p>
The trouble was they loved each other as well. And
she wanted to be loved best.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">A SMALL HERO.</span>
</h2>

<p>
Dr. Collaston and his wife opened their new
house early in September with quite a grand gathering
of friends. It was really very handsome for the
times, and the young wife was considered quite an acquisition
to society, which was rather fluctuating. Louis
Mason esteemed himself very fortunate to obtain a place
in the office of Judge Todd of the Supreme Court.
Charles and Varina went to Williamsburg to school, and
Annis had her mother all to herself once more, for Jaqueline
was in great demand at her sister's.
</p>

<p>
She was not long in meeting Roger Carrington, but
they might have been the merest acquaintances. And as
if to help the family get over the disappointment, Ralph
married a daughter of one of the neighbors, an amiable,
home-loving girl, an excellent housekeeper, and quite up
in the demands of the society of the day. She came
home to live, and Mrs. Carrington had her coveted daughter,
who was entirely satisfied with her position.
</p>

<p>
"We were all very sorry when the difference happened
between you and Roger," Mrs. Carrington said
gently to Jaqueline the first time they met. "But it
was better to learn then that you could not agree than to
have to live unhappy afterward. Still, I hope we shall
remain friends, and I want a visit from your parents very
much."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_208' name='Page_208'>[208]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline thanked her gracefully. Truly, it seemed
to make little difference. Roger looked older and more
dignified, and was in great demand with the inner circle
of both men and women.
</p>

<p>
There were many pressing questions, both in the City
and country. The Napoleonic conquests had shaken
Europe to its very center, and the first disaster to the
man regarded as invincible produced a thrilling sensation.
Mr. Barlow, author of some quite important pamphlets,
was sent to France to observe affairs, which were
in a rather critical state. The party clamoring for war
with England made itself heard more loudly. The right
of search, the interference of trade, the insolent and
overbearing manner of England roused the whole
country.
</p>

<p>
Through all the turmoil Mrs. Madison moved serenely,
and if her heart quaked with forebodings, it was not allowed
to disturb her efforts at making Washington a social
center. Then her pretty widowed sister, Mrs. Washington,
married Judge Todd, and so became permanently
settled in the City. Every year saw a little improvement
made in the Capitol and the President's mansion. Streets
began to have a more finished appearance.
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline was not less a belle than she had been the
previous winter. Arthur Jettson was prospering, and
Jane was bright and gay in spite of three babies; so between
the two homes and the outside world she was kept
full of engagements.
</p>

<p>
She was rather surprised when Lieutenant Ralston
made her a proposal of marriage. The friendly feeling
had been so strong, and on her part so unlike love, that
there could be but one answer. He did not seem deeply
disappointed, but begged that they might remain friends.
</p>

<p>
Only a few days after she received a note from her
mother. They had been up to the Pineries, for grandmother
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_209' name='Page_209'>[209]</a></span>
was quite poorly and went downstairs only to her
dinner.
</p>

<p>
"She misses the stir and activity of being mistress of
the house, and her son's ideas are different in many respects
from hers. But there comes a time when the old
must give way and step aside for the young. Marian is
devoted to her. I do not know now what your grandmother
would do without her. Did you hear that poor
Mr. Greaves is dead at last? But it has been a living
death for six months or more; indeed, he has never had
his mind and memory clearly since the first stroke, and
now for weeks he has been barely conscious. He must
have had an iron constitution. I think your grandmother
is very thankful that this happened before the marriage
rather than afterward. Miss Greaves wants to close the
house, dispose of the slaves by hire or leasing, and go to
England to educate the children. Brandon is as bitterly
opposed to war as ever his father could have been.
Marian is sweet and kindly, but has fallen into an apathetic
state. Dolly is prospering, and from all accounts
very gay. She has written repeatedly to Marian. I wish
the poor girl could make the visit. It is sad to see her
youth fading away."
</p>

<p>
"Poor Marian! Oh, Patty, do you remember our first
visit here? It seems ages ago, doesn't it? and so much
has happened. What girls we were!"
</p>

<p>
"And Mr. Madison was inaugurated! You went to a
levee. How I did envy you! Now I curtsey to Mrs.
Madison every day or two, and gossip with Mrs. Cutts,
and am asked to meet this one and that one. Well, we're
the Virginian part of the Capital," laughing. "And how
you schemed for Marian! Jaqueline, you don't mean to
marry Lieutenant Ralston yourself, after all? Jane was
so afraid you might attract him."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no! He seems just like a brother." But she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_210' name='Page_210'>[210]</a></span>
did not confess she had answered the momentous question.
She gave a great throb of thankfulness. True, he
insisted that Marian had never really loved him, and a
man would be foolish enough to go mooning about such
a woman.
</p>

<p>
It was June of that year, after a stormy session of Congress,
that the word spread like wildfire through every
State, first announced in the <i>National Intelligencer</i>, that
war had been declared against Great Britain. And on
June 21 the strongest naval force the country could
muster, a squadron of four warships, was fitting out at
Norfolk. Charleston was astir; New York, Boston, and
Salem were busy transforming merchant vessels that had
lain idly at the wharves into fighting ships. Young
men hurried to Annapolis and placed themselves in
training, for the war must be largely fought out on the
seas.
</p>

<p>
The efforts of England to harass and break up the
commerce between the United States and other countries,
notably France, had exasperated the pride and sense of
justice of the country. The war-cry was taken up: "Free
trade and the rights of sailors. America must protect
her own." And although times had been hard and trade
poor, out of it had grown a knowledge of the young
country's power and possibilities. Now the nation was
compact and had a centralized government. There had
been many improvements since old Revolutionary times,
and the population had nearly doubled.
</p>

<p>
Not that the country was a unit on this subject. The
Federalists were extremely bitter, and denounced the war
as unnecessary and suicidal. England, out of one war,
was ready with her ripened experience to sweep us from
the seas. And what then?
</p>

<p>
On the frontier the campaign opened badly. At the
disgraceful surrender of Hull at Detroit not only was the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_211' name='Page_211'>[211]</a></span>
commander blamed for treachery and cowardice, but the
Cabinet and the President held up to execration.
</p>

<p>
As an offset, naval victories suddenly roused the waning
enthusiasm: the <i>Wasp</i> and the <i>Frolic</i>, the <i>Hornet</i>
and the <i>Peacock</i>, and the <i>Constitution's</i> splendid escape
from the <i>Guerrière</i>, that was to drive the "insolent
rag of bunting" from the seas, the chase from New York
to Boston, the brief fight of an hour and a half, when the
bunting was left to wave over the wreck, and Captain
Dacres and the part of his crew not in a watery grave
made prisoners. No wonder Boston had a day of rejoicing!
</p>

<p>
This was followed by other victories. The country
began to draw a free breath, and the conquest on the lakes
crowned it with new courage and rejoicing.
</p>

<p>
But in the Capital a fierce battle was raging. Whether
Madison should again be the candidate and succeed himself
was a hotly disputed question. But if the President
came in for so much animadversion, it was admitted
that Mrs. Madison bore herself with steady courage and
cheerfulness. There was no distinction made between
parties at her receptions. No one was treated with coolness
because he had reviled the administration. Perhaps
it was the charming courtesy that upheld Mr. Madison
through the stress of the times.
</p>

<p>
Then Jaqueline and Dr. Collaston were summoned suddenly
to Cedar Grove. Charles had been brought home
in a rather alarming condition. There had been spells of
fainting and headaches that were thought to come from
overstudy, and at last Uncle Conway was seriously
alarmed, and sent the boy home in the care of a trusty
slave and an old mammy. He was very much exhausted
by the journey, and Dr. Collaston saw at once that it was
something more serious than overwork.
</p>

<p>
"But I'll be sure to get well, won't I?" he asked wistfully.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_212' name='Page_212'>[212]</a></span>
"There is so much going on, and so much to do
and to learn in this big world. How grand it is! And
if we should beat England again, wouldn't it be magnificent?
Do you feel sure that we will?"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind the war. Tell me when the headaches
began. And the pain in your back. You used to be
such a bright, healthy little lad. Did you take enough
exercise?"
</p>

<p>
There was a faint flush creeping over the pale face, and
the eyes looked out on the distance as if taxing his
memory, but instead he was trying to elude a curious
consciousness.
</p>

<p>
"The headaches? Oh, I used to have them sometimes
at home. They're girlish things, and it doesn't seem as
if boys ought to fret over them," with a touch of disdain.
</p>

<p>
"And you haven't been trying your strength leaping
over five-barred gates or jumping ditches, or perhaps
riding too much?"
</p>

<p>
"I had my pony, you know, but I didn't ride very
much. And latterly it seemed to take away my strength.
Aunt Catharine was sure it hurt me, and then I didn't
ride at all. So I left it for the children and Varina.
Aunt Catharine was wonderfully kind, but she isn't quite
like mamma, and father is so good and strong. I'm
going to get well now. I think I was homesick too, and
that's babyish for a great boy. How Louis would laugh
at me!"
</p>

<p>
But no one laughed. Everybody spoke hopefully, to
be sure, and treated the matter lightly. Annis read to
him, but he sometimes stopped her and said: "Tell me
about your visit to Patty. Doesn't it seem funny to have
Patty among the big people and going to the White
House to dinner? Why do you suppose Jacky didn't
marry Mr. Carrington? I like him so much."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_213' name='Page_213'>[213]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Then it was the old Froissart, with the queer pictures,
or the war news. The young people around came
in, the boys ruddy, laughing, and sunburned. The little
darkies did their funniest tricks and sang songs for young
mas'r; but though he seemed a little stronger, he did not
get well. It had not been altogether the hard study.
</p>

<p>
"You are quite sure you can't remember any fall
down there at Williamsburg?" the doctor queried.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I might have had little tumbles; boys often do,"
he said with an air of indifference. "But nothing to
hurt."
</p>

<p>
He caught a look on the face of Annis, who was standing
by the window idly drumming with her fingers on the
sill, and frowned.
</p>

<p>
"What was that for?" The doctor intercepted the
glance, and looked from one to the other.
</p>

<p>
"Please don't drum, Annis," he said gently. "Did
I frown?" to the doctor.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Collaston studied him sharply.
</p>

<p>
"If you young people have any secret that bears on
the case, you'd better reveal it. Working in the dark
isn't always advisable. Annis, why do you change
color?"
</p>

<p>
Annis flushed deeply now, and her eyelids quivered as
if tears were not far away.
</p>

<p>
"Let Annis alone," said the boy in as gruff a tone
as so gentle a voice could assume. "I suppose we
<i>did</i> both think of one thing when you so insisted
upon a fall. It was a long while ago, before I
went to school. We were down by the creek. I
was on Sam, who had been drinking and wading
in the stream. He turned to step out, and a
stone rolled and he stumbled. I went over his head, as
I didn't have the rein in my hand. It knocked the breath
out of me for a moment. But I had been tumbled off before,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_214' name='Page_214'>[214]</a></span>
when I was learning to ride, and that really didn't&mdash;wasn't
of much account, only Annis was so frightened.
Now shall I go further back and tell you of all the downfalls
I have had? I wasn't very daring&mdash;Annis, wasn't
I something of a babyish boy?"
</p>

<p>
"No, you were not." Annis smiled a little then.
</p>

<p>
"How did he fall?"
</p>

<p>
Annis could not recall that.
</p>

<p>
"After a little I walked home. No, I wasn't much
hurt. I had a lame thumb, I remember; but afterward
there used to come what Phillis calls a 'misery' in my
back. The headaches did not come until in the
winter."
</p>

<p>
The doctor nodded.
</p>

<p>
"But I'm bound to get well," added the boy. "I don't
want to die. I should have to be dead such a long, long
while."
</p>

<p>
The doctor laughed. "No, we're not going to have
you die. That is the least of the trouble. But you may
be an invalid quite a while."
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't even mind that, if I could study some. I
hate to fall behind. And, you see, father is so proud of
Louis that I couldn't bear people saying about me 'Poor
Charles!' in a pitying way."
</p>

<p>
"We won't even have them saying that," was the confident
answer, as he went out to add a note to the memoranda
he had made of the case.
</p>

<p>
Charles held out his hand to Annis, who came over and
gave it a little convulsive clasp.
</p>

<p>
"Girls are queer," he said in a soft, slow tone that
had no reproach in it. "And Dr. Collaston turned you
inside out. I do suppose doctors know pretty generally
what is going on inside of your body, and sometimes they
guess what is in your brain, or your mind, or whatever
thinks. I was so afraid he'd get it all out of you!"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_215' name='Page_215'>[215]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Oh, do you think it was <i>that</i>?" Annis' eyes overflowed,
and he could feel the quiver of her fingers.
</p>

<p>
"There&mdash;don't cry. It wasn't your fault. It wasn't
even Varina's fault. Sam would have turned and gone
out, anyhow. And you can't think how nice Varina is
growing&mdash;pretty, too. I am sure it vexed her a good
deal to think she was not as pretty as the older girls, or
even you. You're so fair and sweet, with your clouds
of light hair and your skin that looks like transparent
pearl. You know she was very sorry."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we both thought you were dead!" Annis tried
hard not to sob.
</p>

<p>
"Boys take a good deal of killing. You see, I wasn't
anywhere near dead. But I did give my back a hard
wrench, and I felt it for a week or two, then it all went
away; and it was somewhere about the holidays&mdash;we were
getting greens for the church, and I fainted dead away.
After that the ache came back. It's dull and aggravating,
not a sharp pain that makes you feel as if you could
get up and fight, but sometimes you are wild to run away,
to the very ends of the earth! Then it would creep up
to my head like some stealthy thing you couldn't put
your finger on. Aunt Catharine was good, but she fussed
so much, and she's always saying, 'Now, don't you think
you ought to do this, or give up doing that? I'm sure it
hurts you.' And wanting to find out the cause of everything
and settle it on some particular point. It's queer
that Rene should get along so well; you know she has a
fractious temper! But the little girls just adore her, and
at home she was teased a good deal."
</p>

<p>
He leaned back on the pillow, and his face was very
white.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you are so tired!" cried Annis.
</p>

<p>
"Yes. I have just a little bit to say, then you may
read to me. I don't want anything said about Varina.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_216' name='Page_216'>[216]</a></span>
She would be almost killed if she thought she was to
blame for it. And she wasn't, you know. That little
splash in Sam's face wasn't anything. He enjoyed having
a bucket of water thrown over him. He's almost a
water dog," laughing.
</p>

<p>
Annis tried to be convinced. If Varina had not persisted
when Charles asked her to stop! But, then, Sam
<i>had</i> stepped on a rolling stone.
</p>

<p>
"That's just a little bit between ourselves, not to be
talked about, for it can't do any good, and would make
Rene so very unhappy, now when she's growing sweeter.
I've thought I ought to tell the doctor, but I didn't want
to believe the fall had anything to do with it. Whatever
happens, you will always love me, Annis?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," bending over to kiss the white forehead, her
heart full of sympathy and dread for an unknown future.
</p>

<p>
"And Jack's so lovely! Only I'm awful sorry she
didn't marry Mr. Carrington. Patty and her husband
are so happy, so are mother and father. There, I am
tired. Get a book and read. That about Uncle Toby,
who had such a big, sweet, foolish heart."
</p>

<p>
The children had a great way of picking out parts they
liked and skipping the rest.
</p>

<p>
Then Dr. Collaston had to go up to Washington for a
week or two, and sent for Jaqueline also. For Patty had
a little baby girl, and they all laughed merrily about being
uncles and aunts. What was happening to the country
was a minor consideration.
</p>

<p>
When the doctor came down again he had a well-digested
plan.
</p>

<p>
"If it wasn't for running the risk on the ocean I should
say take the boy over to London at once and have the
best medical skill there. But there are some excellent
physicians in Philadelphia and New York. Old Dr.
Rush does little in practicing now, but he is still ready
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_217' name='Page_217'>[217]</a></span>
and generous with advice. You know, I am young in
the profession, and as yet we cannot boast much medical
talent in our young city. Let Mrs. Mason stay with him
three months or so, and have the best treatment. I think
it quite a serious matter."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Mason was aghast at first.
</p>

<p>
"He is so young now, and the injury may not be as bad
as I anticipated; but it will need excellent skill to take
him through without leaving permanent marks and much
suffering. So it had better be attended to at once."
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline was alarmed at the seriousness of the case.
If she could go&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"No; it must be some person of experience, and one
whom Charles loves and trusts and would obey. He will
make a good patient, for he is anxious to get well; and
though he does not whisper such a thing, he has an awful
fear of deformity&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you do not think&mdash;" in a tremulous tone.
</p>

<p>
"Hush! I have mentioned it to no one but your parents.
It is not to be discussed. It is a spinal trouble,
and that covers the ground. And he must have immediate
care. You and Annis will come with us, for it would
be too lonely to have you here on the plantation, even if
your father is back and forth."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Mason discussed the plans with Jaqueline at once,
and the girl was full of the warmest sympathy.
</p>

<p>
"If we could take Annis! but the doctor thinks it
would be bad for the child, and an added care."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, mamma, you may trust her with me! I am not
as gay and volatile as I was a year ago, nor so frivolous."
</p>

<p>
"She ought to go to school! Perhaps in the fall&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Mamma, that suggests something. A Madame
Badeau, a very charming French refugee, has started a
school for children and young ladies just a short distance
from the doctor's. She is trying to get scholars enough
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_218' name='Page_218'>[218]</a></span>
to insure her support. And she teaches the pianoforte.
It is quite coming into vogue since Mrs. Madison makes
so much of the grand one at the White House, where
ladies are often asked to play. Annis is such a little
home girl that she would be very unhappy away. We all
love her so dearly. And I will look after her clothes,
and the doctor after her health, and Patty and the baby
will be so much entertainment. Patty is making a very
charming woman, and much admired," said the elder sister
heartily.
</p>

<p>
"That is an admirable plan, and you are kind to take
so much interest in the child. It relieves me of considerable
anxiety, and she has run wild long enough, though
she has picked up an odd conglomeration of knowledge
from Charles. I know your father will be glad and
thankful."
</p>

<p>
"To let you go quite away&mdash;to stay!" ejaculated Annis,
when she heard of the plan. "Mamma, I have given
up part of you a good many times, but I can't give up
all," and the soft lips quivered. "Why can I not go? I
will be very good, and not make any trouble. And I
could help you with Charles, and read to him. He is so
fond of me."
</p>

<p>
"It would not be possible to take you, dear," she replied
tenderly. "You would add to my care. The doctor
thinks this plan the best, the only one."
</p>

<p>
Annis clung to her mother. "Philadelphia is ever so
much farther than Baltimore!" she cried despairingly.
"And&mdash;you are <i>my</i> mother!"
</p>

<p>
"But, if Charles should be ill a long while! And think
how lonesome he would be with just a nurse! You can
write quite well, and you can send me letters about everything.
Jaqueline knows of a delightful school you can
go to. It is time you were learning something, as well as
Varina. There, dear, don't make it harder for me."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_219' name='Page_219'>[219]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Annis was crying on her mother's shoulder. She had
thought a three- or four-days' separation very hard&mdash;how
would she stand weeks and months? To be sure,
they all loved her mother, and Charles was especially
fond of her; but, after all, she was <i>her</i> mother.
</p>

<p>
Then Mr. Mason came in, but for once she would not
sit on his knee nor listen to his bright predictions.
</p>

<p>
At first Charles refused utterly to go without Annis.
He was sure she couldn't be in the way. He loved
mamma very much, but he had found it lonely at school
without Annis to tell things over to. She was different
from the other girls&mdash;and, then, they were grown women,
except Varina; and he could not stand it without her.
</p>

<p>
"I want to get well and grow up to manhood, and then
none of you shall take her away from me!" he cried.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Mason gave a soft sigh, hoping he would have no
greater heartache in the days to come.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Collaston finally persuaded him that this would be
the best arrangement, as quiet and a darkened room
might be necessary. "And it would be like keeping her
a prisoner," he said. "Her mother could not take her
out, and she could not go about a strange city alone, so it
would be rather selfish to ask so much of her."
</p>

<p>
"And I don't mean to be selfish. If you all think so,
it must be right; but I am sorry, all the same."
</p>

<p>
"You may get home by Christmas," the doctor said
hopefully.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">IN OLD WASHINGTON.</span>
</h2>

<p>
There were many arrangements to make. Only Mr.
and Mrs. Mason knew how really serious the case
might be, and Mrs. Mason felt that she could not accept
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_220' name='Page_220'>[220]</a></span>
the responsibility alone. Dixon, the overseer, was a
good manager and a trusty man, and his wife a very
efficient woman. Indeed, the older house slaves could
have run the place without supervision, but it was well to
have a responsible head. Louis would come down now
and then and inspect the financial affairs, and bring Jaqueline
occasionally. It would not be quite like going to
London, and Mr. Mason might return if really needed.
</p>

<p>
So they packed up and put things in order, and went up
to Washington to settle Annis. Charles seemed really
stronger, but the doctor knew it was only excitement.
Patty's house was so pretty and the office so handy, the
boy did not see why he could not remain with her.
</p>

<p>
The house was quite fine for the times. Land was
abundant, and houses did not have to crowd. There
were spacious rooms, for people were hospitably inclined.
Southern women made charming hostesses. In an ell
part the doctor had an office, for he was quite ambitious
in his profession, if he had one eye on the advancement
of the City. He had rented one of his houses, and
another was likely to be sold.
</p>

<p>
There were people who shook their heads dubiously
and feared an invasion; others reasoned there was so
little prospect of booty in Washington compared to the
commercial cities, there could be no possible danger.
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline had a pretty corner room. Opening into it
was a smaller one devoted to Annis, with its dainty bed
curtained with white muslin and fringe that nodded in
the slightest breeze. The floor was painted, and a rug
made by the slaves at home lay at the bedside. Grandmother
had sent Patty the mahogany furnishing of one
room that she had brought from the Mason house when
she was married, and it was quite an heirloom. This
was in Jaqueline's room.
</p>

<p>
The baby went far toward reconciling Annis. A
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_221' name='Page_221'>[221]</a></span>
pretty, plump little thing, with great dark eyes and a
fringe of dark hair over a white forehead, she looked
like a picture. Judy, one of the slaves from home, was
her nurse.
</p>

<p>
Yet the parting was very hard for Annis. The doctor
had taken Charles in his own carriage. They were
to go to Baltimore and rest a day or two and visit some
of the connections.
</p>

<p>
Annis felt at first as if she must be visiting.
</p>

<p>
"And do you remember we came up to Mr. Madison's
inauguration and went to the Capitol? It seems as if it
must have been years and years ago, so many things have
happened since then. And everybody seems grown up
except Charles and I."
</p>

<p>
"You were a tiny little girl then. I hope you will not
be very homesick; there are so many things to see. And
when the horses are sent up we can take beautiful rides."
</p>

<p>
Annis swallowed over a lump in her throat.
</p>

<p>
"The baby will grow and be very cunning. And every
week you are to write to mamma."
</p>

<p>
"And to Charles. I am not to mind not getting answers
from him; it makes his head ache to write."
</p>

<p>
"And, then, there are the children at Aunt Jane's.
Her baby talks everything in the funniest crooked fashion.
To-morrow we will call on Madame Badeau. I
hope you will like school. It is only in the morning."
</p>

<p>
"I am fond of learning things if they are not too
hard."
</p>

<p>
"Some of us have to learn quite hard lessons," and
Jaqueline sighed.
</p>

<p>
Madame Badeau lived in a rather shabby-looking rough
stone house, quite small in the front, but plenty large
enough for her and a serving-man and maid, and running
back to a pretty garden, where she cultivated all
manner of beautiful flowers, and such roses that lovers
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_222' name='Page_222'>[222]</a></span>
of them were always begging a slip or piece of root.
There was a parlor in the front filled with the relics of
better days, and draped with faded Oriental fabrics that
were the envy of some richer people. There was always
a curiously fragrant perfume in it. Next was the schoolroom,
entered by a side door, where there were small
tables in lieu of desks, wooden chairs, and a painted floor
that the maid mopped up freshly every afternoon when
the children were gone. Back of this were the living
room and a very tiny kitchen, while upstairs were two
rooms under the peaked roof, where Madame and Bathsheba
slept.
</p>

<p>
Madame was small, with a fair skin full of fine wrinkles.
She wore a row of curls across her forehead,
a loosely wound, soft white turban that gave her a curious
dignity, and very high heels that made a little click
as she went around. She was quite delicate, and had exquisite
hands, and wore several curious rings. Her voice
was so finely modulated that it was like a strain of music,
and she still used a good many French words. She had
been at the French court and seen the great Franklin
and many other notables, and had to fly in the Reign
of Terror, with the loss of friends and most of her
fortune.
</p>

<p>
Bathsheba, the maid, was nearly six feet tall, and proud
of some Indian blood that gave her straight hair and an
almost Grecian nose. She was proud of her mistress too,
and was in herself a bodyguard when Madame went out.
The old man who kept the garden clean and did outside
work was a slave too old for severe labor, and was
hired out for a trifle. At night he went home to sleep at
the cabin of a grandchild.
</p>

<p>
Annis was attracted at once by the soft voice that ended
a sentence with a sort of caressing cadence. And when
Jaqueline wrote her name in full Madame said:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_223' name='Page_223'>[223]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Bouvier. That is French. Your mamma's maiden
name, perhaps?"
</p>

<p>
"No," returned Annis, with a little color. "It was
my own papa, who is dead. And he could read and talk
French. I knew a little, but I was so young when he
died."
</p>

<p>
"And our father married Mrs. Bouvier some years
ago," said Jaqueline, "so Annis and five of us Mason children
constitute the family. Mrs. Bouvier was cousin to
our own mother."
</p>

<p>
"I shall take great pleasure in teaching you French.
Poor France has had much to suffer. And now that detestable
Corsican is on the throne, with no drop of royal
blood in his veins! but you can tell what he thinks of it
when he divorces a good and honorable woman that his
son may inherit his rank. But my nation did not take
kindly to a republic. They are not like you," shaking her
turbaned head.
</p>

<p>
The distance to school was not great, so in fair weather
it was a nice walk. Now the place is all squares and circles
and rows of beautiful houses, but then people almost
wondered at the venturesomeness of Dr. Collaston and
Mr. Jettson building houses in country ways; for although
streets were laid out and named, there was little
paving. The Mason tract was on Virginia Avenue, but
the others had gone back of the Executive Mansion, on
high ground, and had a fine view of the whole country;
and Georgetown being already attractive, it seemed possible
the space between would soon be in great demand.
</p>

<p>
Out beyond them were some fine old mansions belonging
to the time of plantations and country settlements.
The very last of the preceding century the Convent
of the Visitation had been erected, for so many of
the Maryland gentry were Roman Catholics. There was
a school for girls here, mostly boarding scholars.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_224' name='Page_224'>[224]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Then Rock Creek stretched way up on the heights,
threading its path in and out of plantations where fields
were dotted with slaves at their work, often singing
songs with the soft monotonous refrain that suggested the
rhythm of the distant ocean. Occasionally you met a
silvery lake that bosomed waving shadows; then
stretches of gigantic oaks, somber pines, and hemlocks;
and now and then a little nest of Indian wigwams whose
inhabitants preferred quasi-civilization.
</p>

<p>
To the southeast, on the Anacostia River, was the navy
yard, active enough now. And there was Duddington
Manor, with its high wall and stately trees overtopping
it, built by Charles Carroll, to be for a long while a
famous landmark in solitary grandeur. But the Van
Ness mansion, nearer the Potomac, was always alight,
and often strains of music floated out on the night air to
the enjoyment of the passer-by.
</p>

<p>
Annis had been living in a kind of old world, peopled
with the heroes of Homer, the knights of Arthur, and the
pilgrims of Chaucer, as well as Spenser's "Faërie
Queene." She had a confused idea that Pope's garden
was in some of these enchanted countries, and that Ben
Jonson and Shakspere were among the pilgrims who
sang songs and told tales as they traveled on, or stopped
at the roadside and acted a play. Charles had learned
where to place his heroes and who of them all were real.
</p>

<p>
Annis left the realm of imagination and fancy and
came down to actual study. At first she did not like it.
</p>

<p>
"But you must know something about modern events,"
declared Jaqueline, "to read well and write a nice letter;
and to understand the history of our own country, which
is all real. And to keep accounts&mdash;every housekeeper
ought to be able to do that. Grandmamma had to look
after the big plantation until papa came of age; and women
have to do a good many different things."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_225' name='Page_225'>[225]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I think I shall like learning them, or most of them,"
and Annis' eyes shone.
</p>

<p>
"There is dancing, too; you must go in a class next
winter. You can embroider nicely, so you needn't bother
about that. And I have been in a painting class where
there were some quite small girls. Some ladies paint
fans and flower pieces beautifully. And Patty thinks she
will have a pianoforte, which would be delightful. Singing
classes are in vogue, too."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear, can one learn so much?" and the child
looked perplexed.
</p>

<p>
"You do not have to learn it all at once," returned the
elder with a smile.
</p>

<p>
Very few people had any thought of vacations then.
True, Washington had a dull spell when Congress was
not in session, and some of the people retired to country
places or went to the Eastern Shore of Maryland, or to
Bladensburg to drink medicated waters. But Madame
Badeau kept her school going from eight to twelve for
the children's classes. They were all composed of girls,
for while Madame admired well-bred young men very
much, she could not tolerate growing boys. The afternoons
were devoted to what were called fancy branches.
Young women came to learn embroidery and lace-making,
the duties on foreign goods were so high, and now the
risk of importing was so great.
</p>

<p>
There began to be a different feeling about education.
Intelligent women were coming to the fore. To
be sure, science was considered unwomanly, but handsome
and well-bred Mrs. Gallatin knew enough on many
subjects to entertain her husband's guests charmingly.
Everybody would have been horrified at the thought of a
woman's college, and if a woman's convention had been
announced it would have created more indignation than
the war was raising.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_226' name='Page_226'>[226]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Yet women with but few early advantages went to
Madame Badeau to be trained in conversation and the art
of writing polite notes, and some who had a facility for
verse-making to learn how an acrostic was put together,
or an anagram, and the proper fashion for congratulatory
verses. A few women poets had appeared, but the
French "blue stockings" were quoted in derision. Still,
it had occurred to other women beside Mrs. Adams that
the mothers of sons trained for perilous times needed to
be intelligent, at least.
</p>

<p>
For the first time Annis was thrown with a variety of
girls near her own age. None of them were like Varina&mdash;but,
then, they were not like each other. How strange
there should be so many different kinds of people in the
world! It amazed her.
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline was much interested in her unfolding. There
was a delicious quaintness about her that contact with
Madame Badeau brought out. She had some very clear
ideas too, and there was so much to write about.
</p>

<p>
"I shall have to send a letter to mamma one week and
to Charles the next," she said sagely. "Then I shall not
tell the same things over."
</p>

<p>
"That is an excellent idea. You are a bright little
girl," returned Jaqueline with a smile.
</p>

<p>
"And it will save my own time. Jaqueline, can't we
go to Washington some time and really see it? One
of the girls called me a country lass because I did not
know about the streets and the way everything ran. And
how queer they should be named after the letters and
numbers! What will they do when the letters are exhausted?&mdash;and
there are but twenty-six."
</p>

<p>
"There are the numbers, you know."
</p>

<p>
"But the numbers run criss-cross. Do you suppose
they will go on as we work a sampler, make little letters
and then Old-English text? One girl has the most beautiful
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_227' name='Page_227'>[227]</a></span>
Old-English alphabet worked in red silk, but it is
very hard to tell the letters."
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline laughed. "No! I think they will take names
then."
</p>

<p>
"They make up parties and go to Analostan Island.
And, do you know, there are beautiful falls up the Potomac,
ever so far!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; they are beautiful, indeed; and we will get the
doctor to take us up some time."
</p>

<p>
"Everything is so"&mdash;glancing around for a word&mdash;"so
interesting. And there are so many people. I like
it very much. Only if we could have mamma and Charles
and papa! Then, it would be mean to crowd out
Varina."
</p>

<p>
"We'll have the whole household at Christmas."
</p>

<p>
Louis was very much interested in the surprise and
pleasure over everything, and he found Annis quite a
delightful companion for walks. She was so eager to
hear about the founding of the City.
</p>

<p>
"It has only come of age," said Louis. "For the cornerstone
was laid in 1793."
</p>

<p>
"And there are cities in Europe over a thousand years
old! Oh, what an old world it must be!"
</p>

<p>
"But we are a new country altogether. Then, we have
much older cities."
</p>

<p>
"After all," she said reflectively, "the ground was
here. And some of the houses and the people."
</p>

<p>
They were still working on the Capitol. Stonecutters
and marble-dressers in their little sheds were a common
sight.
</p>

<p>
A great many people went to Christ Church, which had
been erected soon after the laying out of the City. Then
there was old St. Paul's, that had stood nearly a century,
built, as many other places were, of brick brought from
England. Since that day many a secret had been learned,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_228' name='Page_228'>[228]</a></span>
and during the last three years the United States had
manufactured largely, though many people sighed for
foreign goods.
</p>

<p>
There were two weeks in August when Madame Badeau
went away for a little rest and change of air. Mrs.
Collaston decided to spend a fortnight at Bladensburg,
and though Aunt Jane cheerfully offered to keep Annis,
Jaqueline insisted upon adding her to the party. Little
Elizabeth Patricia, commonly called Bessie, and by her
father Queen Bess, was thriving wonderfully.
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline had changed a good deal, but she was a
greater favorite than ever, it seemed, and had no end of
admirers. One of them, a very popular and well-to-do
gentleman, made her an offer of marriage.
</p>

<p>
"Are you really going to stay single forever?" exclaimed
her sister. "I wouldn't take Roger Carrington
now if he asked me again. A man who cannot overlook
a little tiff&mdash;though you did flirt shamefully, Jaqueline!
But it doesn't much matter. I observe the men are just
as ready to be flirted with again. Only don't wait too
long, and don't pass by the good chances."
</p>

<p>
Having made an excellent marriage herself, she considered
that her counsel and advice were worth a good
deal to her unmarried friends.
</p>

<p>
Roger Carrington seemed to have passed out of Jaqueline's
radius, whether purposely or not. Ralston spent
much of his time out of Washington, inspecting and
planning fortifications. Jaqueline kept up a friendly, occasional
correspondence with him, and he had been
strongly interested about Charles' mishap.
</p>

<p>
She was much too proud to allow herself to think she
still cared for Roger, yet she admitted in her secret heart
she had seen no one to put in his place, though there
might be men quite as worthy.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Collaston went up to Philadelphia for a few days,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_229' name='Page_229'>[229]</a></span>
and learned that his worst fears in regard to Charles had
been realized. The most celebrated surgeon at that time,
who bade fair to do quite as much for the advancement of
medicine as Dr. Benjamin Rush had done in his day, a
Dr. Physic, had been noting the case carefully, and decided
that only an operation could prevent a settled deformity.
Charles was growing stronger in some respects,
and when the weather became cooler this would be
undertaken.
</p>

<p>
He told the elders, but they kept Annis in ignorance.
She went back to school; and, though she had been small
for her age, seemed suddenly to shoot up and outgrow
everything.
</p>

<p>
"And I shall not be little Annis any longer. I suppose
everybody does grow taller and older. And now I am
past thirteen. When shall I be old enough to curtsey to
Mrs. Madison?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you can do that at any time. And since Varina
has gone to Charleston to visit Dolly Floyd, you ought
to have some indulgence. She has been to a reception at
the Governor's."
</p>

<p>
The election of Madison for a second term had been
largely the result of the victories that had thrilled the
nation. The navy was springing into existence as if by
magic. Some fine English ships had been captured and
graced by the Stars and Stripes, and were doing brilliant
work under their new colors.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Constellation</i> came up the Potomac, gayly decorated
with flags and bunting, and Captain Stewart gave
a grand dinner, at which the President and his wife and
Mrs. Madison's son, then a handsome and elegantly bred
young man, were among the most distinguished guests.
Louis had obtained cards for himself and lady through
Judge Todd.
</p>

<p>
"You look pretty enough to be married," said Annis
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_230' name='Page_230'>[230]</a></span>
when she saw Jaqueline in her pretty pink gauze gown,
the lace on it run with silver threads, and her dainty
slippers with silver buckles set with brilliants that certainly
did twinkle. The dinner was spread with every
luxury the season afforded, and enhanced by the brilliant
lights and profusion of cut-glass with its sparkling
points. While the elders sat on the quarterdeck surrounded
by some of the chief men of the nation, beneath
an awning of red, white, and blue danced the belles and
beaus.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant Ralston had come late, but he was in time
for the dancing. When he caught sight of Jaqueline
he made his way over to her.
</p>

<p>
"It has been so long since I have seen you!" he exclaimed.
"And I really had not thought of meeting you
to-night, but I shall be in Washington for a fortnight or
more. And gay, pretty Patty has settled into a pattern
wife and mother! Does she read you lectures?"
</p>

<p>
"Sometimes," returned Jaqueline, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me about all the others. It seems an age since
I have heard of any of you."
</p>

<p>
"Then if you make such a little account of my letters
I shall not write you any more."
</p>

<p>
"Nay, do not be so cruel. You can hardly call them
letters, they are so brief. Still, I am glad to get them,
and feel anxious about the poor little boy. You think he
will recover?"
</p>

<p>
"Dr. Physic holds out hopes of a successful termination.
But it will be very slow."
</p>

<p>
"And that dainty little Annis? You are mothering
her? Do you know, your charming solicitude made me
smile. Was she much homesick after her mother?"
</p>

<p>
"Only a little at first. She goes to school and is wonderfully
interested."
</p>

<p>
"And Varina? Our little wasp?" laughingly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_231' name='Page_231'>[231]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Varina is spending the winter with Dolly. You
know she married a Floyd connection. He has been
elected a member of the State legislature this winter.
Varina is quite a young lady. We Masons have a trick
of growing up soon."
</p>

<p>
"And your grandmother? How fares it with her?"
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline smiled inwardly at this mark of respect, and
retailed the little happenings at the Pineries. He listened
attentively when Marian's name was mentioned, and made
no bitter comment. Was it utter indifference?
</p>

<p>
"This is our dance," he said, offering his hand; and
they glided down the polished deck. Then someone else
came for her, and she saw very little more of him until
he marched up to bid her good-by and assure her he
should call speedily.
</p>

<p>
"What a fine fellow Ralston has made!" Louis said
as they were returning home. "He has half a mind to
go in the navy, he tells me. They are winning all the
glory. But he is very eager about the defenses of Washington.
I do wonder if there is any real danger?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I hope not!" anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"No; we do not want the war brought to our door."
</p>

<p>
"New York or Boston will offer greater attractions.
The enemy is raging over the loss of the <i>Guerrière</i>, and
threatens desperate revenge. Oh, we are safe enough!"
</p>

<p>
Annis was eager to hear all about the ball. Was it
prettier because it was on a ship? And wasn't Jaqueline
glad to see Lieutenant Ralston again? Did anyone have
a more beautiful frock?
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes!" laughed Jaqueline.
</p>

<p>
"But no one was any prettier, I am sure," she said
confidently.
</p>

<p>
The enthusiasm over the victories was running high.
The news came of Commodore Decatur's famous victory
off the Canary Islands, when he captured the <i>Macedonian</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_232' name='Page_232'>[232]</a></span>
after an hour and a half of terrific fighting, with the loss
of only five men killed and seven wounded. The <i>United
States</i> brought her prize into New York amid great rejoicing.
</p>

<p>
The news was hailed in Washington with the utmost
enthusiasm. It so happened that the evening had been
selected for a brilliant naval ball, to celebrate the two
other victories, and as a compliment to Captain Stewart.
Ralston had been in a few days before with invitations for
the Collaston household.
</p>

<p>
"I almost wish I was grown up," said Annis wistfully.
"Can't little girls ever see anything?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, she ought to go," declared Ralston. "There
may not be such another event until peace is declared, and
if we go on this way, it must be, ere long. But it will be
a great thing to remember in years to come. Think of the
old ladies who saw our beloved Washington and the
heroes of the Revolution, how glad they are to talk it all
over! Oh, Annis must go, by all means!"
</p>

<p>
"But such a mere child!" said Patty.
</p>

<p>
"Well, she has eyes and ears. I will take her myself.
Mistress Annis Mason, may I have the pleasure of escorting
you to the grand naval ball? It will give me a
great deal of pleasure, I assure you. I am a bachelor,
fancy free, so no one's heart will be broken."
</p>

<p>
He rose as he said this, and crossed the room to where
Annis was sitting, leaning her arm on Jaqueline's knee.
</p>

<p>
The child colored and glanced up in a puzzled manner.
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;why do you not answer?" said Patty in
amusement. "Madame Badeau ought to train you in
polite deportment."
</p>

<p>
"Can I say just what I should like?" a little timidly,
glancing from one sister to the other.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered Patty laughingly. "Yes," said
Jaqueline a little more gravely.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_233' name='Page_233'>[233]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Annis rose and made a formal little courtesy, holding
the side of her skirt with charming grace.
</p>

<p>
"It will afford me the greatest pleasure to accept your
invitation, Lieutenant Ralston," she said in a stately and
dignified manner.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you! That is very handsomely done. After
this show of proper and ceremonious behavior you cannot
refuse her permission?" turning to the elders.
</p>

<p>
"We are vanquished, certainly," admitted Patty.
"Now you may be good enough, perhaps, to tell us
what she must wear."
</p>

<p>
He glanced her over. "Some simple white frock," he
said. "Then you might tie a red ribbon in her hair,
and put on her a blue sash, and she will be the national
colors."
</p>

<p>
"Luckily her hair isn't golden or red or black, so we
shall not startle anyone."
</p>

<p>
"Now, remember there is no white feather to be
shown," said the lieutenant. "You may be a soldier's
wife some day."
</p>

<p>
Annis blushed.
</p>

<p>
Later, when she was alone with Jaqueline, she put her
arms about the elder's neck.
</p>

<p>
"Dear Jaqueline," she said with a tender accent, "do
you think you will like my going to the ball? If it isn't
quite right I will stay at home. And are you sure the
lieutenant was in earnest?"
</p>

<p>
"There is no reason why you should not go, except
that children are not generally taken to balls. And it
will be a grand thing for you to remember."
</p>

<p>
Annis kissed her, much relieved.
</p>

<p>
"I do so want to go," she returned after a little pause.
</p>

<p>
And that morning the news was announced by an extra
from the office of the <i>National Intelligencer</i>. People
went about in high spirits. As soon as the twilight appeared
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_234' name='Page_234'>[234]</a></span>
illuminations sprang up at many important points.
Private houses were aglow from every window, and more
than one flag waved. Washington was full of gayety and
rejoicing. And some who did not go to the ball had
strains of patriotic music to cheer the passer-by.
</p>

<p>
Entertainments began early. Tomlinson's Hotel was
soon filled with guests, the beauty and fashion of the city.
The captured flags of the <i>Alert</i> and <i>Guerrière</i> were arranged
over a sort of dais where Mrs. Madison and the
Cabinet ladies sat, while the secretaries stood about them.
There was a host of military and naval men. Gold lace
and epaulettes and swords gleamed with every movement,
while women were lovely in satins and velvets and
laces. Mrs. Madison wore a handsome gray velvet,
trimmed with yellow satin and lace, and on her head a
filmy sort of turban with some short white plumes. A
neckerchief of fine soft lace rested lightly on her shoulders,
but displayed the still beautiful throat and neck.
The little curls across her forehead were still jet-black,
and though women powdered and rouged, she was one of
the few who "wore a natural complexion," said a newspaper
correspondent.
</p>

<p>
One and another made a bow to her and passed on. Dr.
Collaston and his wife, Jaqueline and a handsome young
naval officer, and then Lieutenant Ralston and his young
charge. Annis was a little bewildered. She had seen
Mrs. Madison in the carriage, and at times walking about
the grounds at the White House; but this really awed
her, and a rush of color came to her fair face. Mrs.
Madison held out her hand, and gave her a kindly
greeting.
</p>

<p>
"What a pretty child!" she said to one of the ladies.
"The American colors, too. How proud the lieutenant
was of her! I remember now that Miss Jaqueline Mason
is quite a belle. Perhaps it is her sister."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_235' name='Page_235'>[235]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"That was beautifully done, Annis," whispered the
lieutenant. "Now there is a friend of mine, a young
midshipman, that you must meet. Will it be out of order
for you to dance, I wonder? And there is Captain Hull.
You must see all the heroes, so you can tell the story
over your grandchildren."
</p>

<p>
It seemed to Annis that everyone must be a hero.
There was the young middy, a Mr. Yardley, who did not
look over sixteen, and who was going out on his first
cruise next week.
</p>

<p>
"Has Miss Mason any relatives in the war?"
</p>

<p>
How queer "Miss Mason" sounded! She looked
about to see who was meant. The young man complimented
her on her colors. He had a brother, a lieutenant
on the <i>Constitution</i>, and two cousins in the army on the
frontier. We should gain the victory again, as we did
in the Revolution. As a boy he used to be sorry he had
not lived then, but this made amends. Only, nothing
could compensate for not having seen Washington, the
hero of them all.
</p>

<p>
Presently the dancing began. Mrs. Collaston and
Jaqueline were both engaged, but Jaqueline put Annis in
charge of a charming middle-aged woman whose daughters
were dancing, and who, being a Virginian and residing
at Yorktown, could recall all the particulars of the
surrender of Lord Cornwallis.
</p>

<p>
Then Annis had her promised dance with the lieutenant.
It was like a bit of fairyland. She thought Cinderella
could not have been any happier with the prince.
Afterward Mr. Yardley came, though by this time the
floor was pretty well crowded. He was about to lead her
back to Jaqueline, who was talking with Mrs. Todd, when
she stopped suddenly and put out her hand.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" she cried, then turned rosy-red.
</p>

<p>
"Is it&mdash;why, it is little Annis Bouvier! Child, how
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_236' name='Page_236'>[236]</a></span>
you have grown! Do they let you go to balls as young as
this?"
</p>

<p>
"I wanted to so much. And it is beautiful! They are
all here&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
There was a sudden commotion. Half a dozen gentlemen
cut off their retreat. Then a whisper went round
the room, growing louder and louder, and cheers sounded
in the hallway.
</p>

<p>
"Ensign Hamilton with the captured flag!"
</p>

<p>
Secretary Hamilton rose, and the throng made way
for him. Just at the doorway they met, the son with
dispatches from Commodore Decatur and the captured
colors of the <i>Macedonian</i>. A cheer almost rent the room.
And as he advanced his mother met him with a clasp of
wordless joy.
</p>

<p>
The President had been detained on some important
business. But the procession made its way to the dais
where the ladies were sitting, and the trophy of victory
was unfurled amid loud acclamations. The band played
"Hail, Columbia!" and when it ceased the young man
modestly made a brief speech. The dispatches were for
the President; the flag he laid at Mrs. Madison's feet&mdash;the
flag that was next of kin to that of the <i>Guerrière</i>.
</p>

<p>
The enthusiasm was so great that the dancing stopped.
The flag was raised to a place beside that of the other
two trophies. Old veterans wiped their eyes, the ladies
waved their handkerchiefs, and more than one voice had
a break in it.
</p>

<p>
Annis stood breathless. Mr. Carrington towered
above her, and he could barely see; but he had heard the
story in the hall, and was repeating it. The clasp of her
soft hand touched him.
</p>

<p>
"If you want to go nearer," he said to Mr. Yardley, "I
will take care of Miss Annis. I am an old friend of the
family."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_237' name='Page_237'>[237]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"It would be hopeless to think of getting her to her
sister's just now. Yes&mdash;I should like to see young Hamilton."
</p>

<p>
"That is excuse enough for anyone," and Carrington
smiled, bowing a polite dismissal.
</p>

<p>
"I am so glad to find you!" Annis said with childlike
simplicity. "We have missed you so much. Where have
you been all this long time?"
</p>

<p>
"We? Who?" He bowed his head a little.
</p>

<p>
"Charles and I. And do you know Charles is ill and
in the doctor's hands at Philadelphia?"
</p>

<p>
"No; I have been away three months&mdash;up on the northern
frontier and in Boston. Poor Charles! Is he likely
to recover?"
</p>

<p>
"He was to come home at Christmas, but he can't
now," and she sighed a little. "And papa too," irrelevantly
thinking of his earlier question. "We were
all sorry."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think everybody could have been," after a
little pause.
</p>

<p>
She raised her soft, beseeching eyes. "Are you still
angry with Jaqueline?" she asked. "I am sure she is
sorry. Patty teases her and says she will be an old maid
because&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Then Annis hung her pretty head.
</p>

<p>
"What makes you think she was sorry?"
</p>

<p>
He looked down into the eyes with an infinite persuasion,
and his voice had an accent hard to resist.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!&mdash;because&mdash;she was sometimes so sad and sweet,
and used to go walking by herself in the twilight. Occasionally
she would let me come. I can't quite tell&mdash;there
are some things you feel. And it isn't right to keep
angry forever."
</p>

<p>
The child's tone was more assured. She was on firmer
moral ground.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_238' name='Page_238'>[238]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Then you think I have been angry long enough?"
It had seemed years to him.
</p>

<p>
"Papa was very angry and scolded Jaqueline, but didn't
keep angry. Charles and I have been so sorry! Oh, you
will make up friends?"
</p>

<p>
"You love Charles as much as ever, then? Happy
Charles! When you have love you have all the best of
life."
</p>

<p>
"Then why don't you ask Jaqueline to love you again?
Oh, I am sure she would!"
</p>

<p>
There was a sweet seriousness in the face and the tone,
the innocence of the child.
</p>

<p>
"And why didn't you go to Philadelphia?" he asked
presently.
</p>

<p>
"I wanted to. Don't you think it hard for a little girl
to be giving up her mother continually? But if it is
best&mdash;They could not take me, and Jaqueline said
she would be like mamma, and love me and care for me.
She is ever so sweet. And Patty and the baby are delightful.
I like Dr. Collaston too. And I am going to
school to a queer, delightful little French woman,
Madame Badeau. And the French I used to know out
in Kentucky all comes back to me."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," smilingly. "I have seen Madame Badeau."
The throng was beginning to move. "Suppose we go
up and have a look at this wonderful flag? I think war
terrible; but it is good to be on the winning side, and
certainly our poor sailors have suffered long enough.
When we are a terror to our enemies they will learn to
respect us. But, thank Heaven, you know nothing about
the terrible side here! May God keep you safely!"
</p>

<p>
She raised her eyes with a grave half-smile as if to
thank him for his benison.
</p>

<p>
The President had come in now. The band was playing
patriotic tunes, several inspiriting Scotch pieces, for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_239' name='Page_239'>[239]</a></span>
just now no one seemed anxious to dance. Ensign Hamilton
was one of the heroes of the occasion, and the pretty
women were saying all manner of complimentary things
to him. There in the throng stood Lieutenant Ralston
and Midshipman Yardley, and, yes, there were Dr. and
Mrs. Collaston.
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline was out of the group, listening to a vivid account
of the taking of the <i>Guerrière</i> and the gala time
there had been in old Boston Town.
</p>

<p>
Patricia turned and espied Annis, who held her head
up proudly and looked as if she were used to going to
balls every week of her life.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mr. Carrington!" reaching over a cordial hand.
"What a stranger you are! I felt I ought to go in search
of Annis, but I knew she was in good hands. Thank
you for your care of her. Wasn't it all grand? Are you
not proud of your country?"
</p>

<p>
"We have worked wonders on the sea, considering how
unprepared we were and the strength of the enemy. I am
no croaker, but we are not through yet. Heaven grant
that we may be successful to the end! After all,
we are a young nation; and we have fought in almost a
new cause, the enlightenment of the people, not the glory
or gain of kings."
</p>

<p>
"Annis, come and curtsey to some of these heroes.
She is over-young for such a place as this, but it will be
a proud thing to remember."
</p>

<p>
The throng shifted again. Ralston stepped aside and
encountered Mr. Carrington.
</p>

<p>
"Roger, old fellow,"&mdash;and though his tone was low it
had a cordial heartiness,&mdash;"in this time of gratulation
private feuds ought to be buried. You were wrong in
your surmise, as I told you then. Between myself and
Miss Mason there has never been anything but the sincerest
friendliness. Still, I asked her to marry me and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_240' name='Page_240'>[240]</a></span>
she declined. Hearts are not so easily caught in the rebound,
after all. And though she has many admirers
she has not been won. Let us be friends again in her
honor, for her sake."
</p>

<p>
"For our own sake, Ralston. If we are ever to make
a grand country we must be united man to man. There
is need enough of it. A scene like this will go far toward
healing many dissensions, public and private. And
I beg you to pardon what I said out of a sore and desperate
heart."
</p>

<p>
"Friends!" repeated Ralston joyously.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">THE FLAG OF VICTORY.</span>
</h2>

<p>
It was true that the victories did go far toward healing
dissensions. While the indignation against England
had run high, there was a bitter opposition in some quarters
to every act of the administration. There was jarring
in the Cabinet as well as outside. The larger cities
had never cordially approved of the Capital at Washington.
They had had rejoicing over successes, and now it
was the turn of the newer city.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Madison's drawing room always presented a gay
and beautiful aspect. Many strangers came to the city.
Washington Irving paid a second visit, and was most
graciously received and became a great favorite. Society
took on a finer aspect. Poets appeared, mostly patriotic
ones; and though to-day we may smile over them,
their sincerity moved the hearts of their readers and won
applause, inspired enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline Mason had taken another ramble around the
room when she saw Roger Carrington talking to her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_241' name='Page_241'>[241]</a></span>
sister. The band played a grand march, and everybody
fell into line, as this seemed to befit the occasion. Then
some of the guests began to disperse, as the President,
who looked very weary, and his smiling, affable wife, with
so many more years of youth on her side, set the example.
</p>

<p>
Carrington loitered with the Collaston party, debating
whether he should meet Jaqueline. It would break the
ice, perhaps. Patty had been so cordial. She had taken
on so many pretty married airs that were charming. She
talked about her house and her lovely baby, how Annis
had grown, and how sweet it was of her to be content
without her mother, and how sad it was about Charles.
Louis joined them, full of enthusiasm. And at last
Jaqueline and her escort came up.
</p>

<p>
"We thought we should have to go home without you,"
Patty said gayly. "Come; it is late. The carriage has
been here waiting ever so long."
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline bowed to her old lover. Major Day, in his
military trappings, was quite an imposing figure, and how
beautiful she was! She had been a pretty young girl
when he first met her; she was young still, in that early
dawn of womanhood before the bud had quite unfolded.
Had he expected to see her faded and worn in this brief
period?
</p>

<p>
They all wished each other good-night.
</p>

<p>
Why did he not "ask Jaqueline to love him again"?
He was not as sure as Annis had been. And now everything
was different. Patty was already quite a figure in
society, and Jaqueline could have her choice of lovers,
husbands.
</p>

<p>
Annis longed to tell over her little episode of the meeting,
but there seemed no time. Jaqueline was always
going out and having company. Louis teased Annis
when he saw her.
</p>

<p>
"Two conquests in one night for a little girl!" he exclaimed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_242' name='Page_242'>[242]</a></span>
"Oh, I saw you dancing with the young midshipman,
and then on high parade with Mr. Carrington,
who looked grave and grand, as if he was escorting about
a lady of high degree. I am afraid Madame Badeau will
make a woman of you too fast. Do you not think it would
be better to send her over to the convent to steady her,
Patty?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't want to be shut up! I should run away.
And I like the girls so much. The convent looks dreary.
And they can walk only in that high-walled garden. I
want the whole big outside world."
</p>

<p>
Louis laughed and pinched her cheek.
</p>

<p>
If Mr. Carrington wouldn't come and ask Jaqueline
again, no one could do anything. Annis sighed in her
tender heart, and felt that it was better not to retail the
confidence.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Madison's dinners were quite the events of the
winter, and her levees were delightful entertainments.
All parties began to harmonize more warmly; perhaps it
was the gracious tact and affability of the hostess. The
<i>National Intelligencer</i> espoused the cause of the Madisons
enthusiastically, and congratulated the nation on his re-election.
Roger Carrington began to haunt the entertainments
he had so long shunned, or at the utmost merely
devoted a few moments to them. Of course he met
Jaqueline, who was simply indifferent, a much harder
condition to overcome than if she had shown hauteur or
resentment. And, then&mdash;in a worldly point of view she
could do better.
</p>

<p>
For Washington, in a certain way, was prospering in
spite of the war and privations. There was a feeling of
permanence, as if the Capital really would be great some
day. Houses were springing up, streets lengthening out,
mudholes being filled up, pavements placed, and every
year a little was added to the home of the nation.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_243' name='Page_243'>[243]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The time ran gayly around. The winter had seemed
unusually brief. March came in again, and with it the
second inauguration of James Madison, when the Capitol
grounds were thronged as never before. The President
was paler and thinner, and though it had been a
triumph for his party, he sighed often for the quiet and
rest of Montpellier.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Madison, in rose-colored satin and ermine, looked
"every inch a queen," said the papers of the day. And
happier than some of the queens off or on European
thrones, even if she had carried a great burden the last
two years. And the ladies of the republican court certainly
were not lacking in beauty or grace. The foreign
ministers and their wives, in all their brave array,
hardly excelled them; and the army and navy were in
force.
</p>

<p>
Annis went to the levee. It was quite a crush, but a
pleasure to the child to see the brilliant throng. Louis
was her escort, and he was proud of her refined and lady-like
manners. The French grace in her nature had been
assiduously cultivated by the woman who still thought
there was no place like France.
</p>

<p>
"We will go home early," Patty said. "Jaqueline is
to stay and help entertain. She's getting to be such a
grand lady that I suppose she will be marrying a senator
or a secretary next, and perhaps be Mrs. President herself.
She and Mrs. Seaton are hand and glove." Mrs.
Seaton was the pretty wife of the editor of the <i>National
Intelligencer</i>. "But I am tired, and the doctor will be
out all night, so we will get some beauty sleep."
</p>

<p>
She sent the servant for the carriage. One of the
guests escorted them through the spacious hall and out
on the portico. A merry party were coming up, and Annis,
turning aside for them, slipped, landing in a little
heap on the stone pavement. Patty uttered a cry.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_244' name='Page_244'>[244]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
A gentleman at the foot of the steps picked her up before
Patty or Mr. Fenton could reach her.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mr. Carrington!" cried Patty; and now the
other guests ran down to see what injury they had done,
quite alarmed at the incident.
</p>

<p>
Annis drew a long sigh and flung her arms about her
rescuer's neck, quite ignorant who it might be, but still
frightened.
</p>

<p>
"No, I do not think I am hurt," in a shaken voice.
</p>

<p>
"Take her to the carriage, please," entreated Patty.
"And, Mr. Fenton, do not mention it to my sister nor my
brother, if you see them. Good-night, and thanks."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Carrington carried her to the edge of the walk and
then put her down.
</p>

<p>
"I feel shaky," she began, with a tremulous laugh.
"But I am quite sure I have not broken any bones."
</p>

<p>
Patty stepped in first. Mr. Carrington assisted Annis,
and then studied the pale face.
</p>

<p>
"Do you not think I had better accompany you?" he
asked solicitously.
</p>

<p>
"But you were just going in to pay your respects to
Mrs. Madison&mdash;" declared Patty.
</p>

<p>
"I shall have four years more to do it in," he returned.
"Where is the doctor? Yes, I had better be sure of your
safety."
</p>

<p>
"He is out on business. Really, he is getting to be
quite hard-worked. And if you would not mind. I
should take it as a favor. Then we can see if Annis is
really injured."
</p>

<p>
He sprang in, and the coachman closed the door.
</p>

<p>
"It was very funny to take that flying leap, as if I
were a bird," and Annis could not forbear laughing.
"What did I look like, dropping at your feet? I was so
bundled up that I couldn't save myself. There is a bump
swelling up on my forehead."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_245' name='Page_245'>[245]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Lucky if there is nothing worse," responded Patty.
</p>

<p>
Annis was carried up the steps and deposited on the
drawing-room sofa. Patty took off her wraps, and
made her stand up and try all her limbs. She began
to feel quite natural and over her fright. There was a
lump on her forehead, but her hood had protected the
skin.
</p>

<p>
"I am delighted to think it is no worse," the gentleman
said.
</p>

<p>
"And it is a pity to have disturbed you. But the doctor
being out, I felt nervous; and a friend is so good at
such a time. I am sure we are much indebted for your
kindness."
</p>

<p>
Annis put out her hand and clasped his. "I am glad
it was you," she said with simple thankfulness.
</p>

<p>
Then they talked of Charles. He had been put in a
plaster jacket. Dr. Collaston was quite sure the best
was being done, but it would be spring before he could be
brought home.
</p>

<p>
Patty was very cordial at the parting, and invited him
to call.
</p>

<p>
"And see what happens to me next," said Annis.
</p>

<p>
"You may be sure I shall want to know."
</p>

<p>
He did not go back to the levee. Jaqueline was there,
being admired and flattered. Now and then he heard
complimentary things said about her, and young men sent
her verses, quite an ordinary event at that time. She had
forgotten, and he remembered only too well. Annis must
have been wrong, yet he had hugged the child's innocent
prattle to his heart. He knew now he had not ceased to
love her, yet he had thought in his pride that if she could
love Ralston he would not stand in the way. His jealousy
had been of the larger, finer type.
</p>

<p>
With all these opportunities she had accepted no lover.
Her attractions were of a more refined kind than when
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_246' name='Page_246'>[246]</a></span>
she had made her first plunge into gayety. Was there
something&mdash;No, he hardly dared believe it. He had
been imperious and arbitrary.
</p>

<p>
He had not the courage to go the next day and inquire
after Annis. He knew it was a polite duty. He walked
down past Madame Badeau's little gray house when
school was being dismissed. There was no Annis among
the girls. What if she had been injured more than they
thought! He would stop and inquire at the office.
There were several men talking eagerly with the doctor,
so he strolled around the corner. Yes, that was Jaqueline
sitting with her face turned from the window, chatting
to someone. The proud poise of the head, the shining
dark curls just shadowing her white neck, the pink
ear like a pearly sea shell, and then her slim white hand
held up in some gesticulation, and the smile that made a
dainty dimple. No, he would not interrupt her; so he
walked on. If she had turned her head&mdash;but she did
not.
</p>

<p>
He was very busy the next day. When he left the office
a carriage full of young girls passed him. Some of them
nodded; he was not quite sure whether <i>she</i> did or not.
Now was his opportunity.
</p>

<p>
The day had been rather raw, with a fitful sunshine, but
now it was clouding over. He walked briskly, and held
his head erect, although he felt rather cowardly at heart.
Why should he not put his fate to the touch, like a man,
or dismiss her from his mind? He sauntered up the stoop
and touched the knocker lightly&mdash;so lightly, indeed, that
Julius, amid the clatter of Dinah's pots and pans, did not
hear it.
</p>

<p>
The carriage stopped. It was rather dusky now, and a
tree hid the figure at the door until Jaqueline was coming
up the steps. His heart beat furiously. He turned, and
they faced each other.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_247' name='Page_247'>[247]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Her hat, with the great bow on the top, was tied under
her chin with rose-colored ribbons. A satin collar edged
with swan's down stood up around her throat and almost
touched the pink cheeks. The great soft, dark eyes
glanced out in surprise&mdash;they could flame in anger too, he
knew that.
</p>

<p>
He had thought more than once how gradually he
would lead up to that old time, and learn if she still loved
him. And she had resolved upon a becoming humility
on his part. He should admit that he had misjudged her,
that he had been selfish, arbitrary, suspicious, jealous,
and&mdash;oh, how many faults she had counted upon her white
fingers!
</p>

<p>
"Jaqueline," he said almost under his breath&mdash;"Jaqueline!"&mdash;and
it seemed as if his voice had never been so
sweet, a fragrant shower falling on a long-parched heart.
He was trying to find her hand; did it come out of the
great muff quite as broad as her slim figure, all soft and
warm, to be pressed to his lips?
</p>

<p>
"Are you very angry still?" she inquired in the dearest,
most beseeching tone.
</p>

<p>
"Angry?" He had forgotten all about it. He had
been fatuous, senseless, to think of such a thing!
</p>

<p>
"Because&mdash;" in a fascinating cadence of pardon.
</p>

<p>
"I have not had a happy moment." His voice was
husky with emotion, with the love that he had told himself
a hundred times was dead, and a hundred times had
disbelieved.
</p>

<p>
"I had given you up. Not that I had ceased&mdash;to care.
And that night of the ball, when the flags came, I was
quite sure you loved me no longer."
</p>

<p>
"I shall love you always. I was mad, foolish, jealous&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And I did flirt. Oh, I was such a vain little thing
then! I am better now. I do not think it so fine to have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_248' name='Page_248'>[248]</a></span>
a host of men making love to you. Only you were wrong
about&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ralston? Yes."
</p>

<p>
"But you must know, he <i>did</i> ask me to marry him. I
do not think it was for love."
</p>

<p>
"I am glad it was not. I told him he owed you an
offer of marriage."
</p>

<p>
"But he did not. There had never been any foolish
softness between us. A Virginian girl may flirt, but she
doesn't give away the sweetness that only a lover is entitled
to. And what if I <i>had</i> loved him?"
</p>

<p>
"If you had loved him I should have wished you Godspeed,
after a while."
</p>

<p>
"But you couldn't have done it at first?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I couldn't." The hearty tone was convincing.
</p>

<p>
It was quite dark now. He put his arm about her and
drew her nearer, nearer, and ceased to kiss her hand.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my darling; here I am keeping you out in the
cold! Are you almost frozen? And I came to hear
about Annis. I have been wondering if I should ever
meet you where I could say a word&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Annis is your very good friend. So was Charles.
And papa was fearfully angry at my folly. They were
all on your side."
</p>

<p>
"And now you are on my side?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," with a soft, happy little laugh.
</p>

<p>
Then he knocked again. This time Julius heard, and
answered.
</p>

<p>
Annis was sitting on the floor, playing with the baby,
who was laughing and cooing.
</p>

<p>
"I thought you wouldn't come&mdash;ever!" she said
vehemently. "I had a headache yesterday, and Patty
wouldn't let me go to school, but the doctor said it didn't
amount to anything. It was funny, though. Jaqueline,
where did you find him?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_249' name='Page_249'>[249]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"On the stoop," and Jaqueline gave a queer little laugh.
How soft and shining her eyes were, and her cheeks were
like pink roses just in bloom. Annis felt something mysterious
stirring in the air. Then Jaqueline ran away.
</p>

<p>
"Did you ask her?" Annis raised her clear eyes with
a sweet, solemn light.
</p>

<p>
"Yes. Annis, you are to be my little sister."
</p>

<p>
"I shall grow big, more's the pity," she said sententiously.
"And I hate to be big!"
</p>

<p>
He laughed at that.
</p>

<p>
The doctor had taken his wife over to Arlington, for he
disliked to ride alone except when he was in great haste;
and just as Dinah had begun to fume about supper they
came in. Mr. Carrington had a warm welcome from
them, and they all laughed over Annis' mishap. But
when Jaqueline entered the story was told, as love stories
always are; and they kept Roger to tea. No one came,
for a cold, drizzling rain set in, and he had Jaqueline to
himself.
</p>

<p>
"Still, she might have done a great deal better," said
Dr. Collaston. "Jaqueline ought to go to some foreign
court as the wife of a minister, she is so elegant. Or the
wife of a secretary of state."
</p>

<p>
He had his desire years afterward, when Jaqueline and
her husband went to the French court. Napoleon had
been swept away by the hand of fate, and royalty sat on
the throne.
</p>

<p>
Roger said they must go over and tell his mother the
joyful news. Ralph's wife was a sweet home body, and
she had a thriving son that was his great-grandmother's
pride. But the mother's heart was strongly centered in
her firstborn, and she had suffered keenly in his sorrows,
though they had never talked them over. They had been
too deep, too sacred.
</p>

<p>
"Only love him, my dear," she said to Jaqueline.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_250' name='Page_250'>[250]</a></span>
"There are some people who think you can love a person
too much; but when they have gone beyond your ken
you are most glad of the times you gave them overflowing
measure." The young girl knew then she was forgiven.
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline was not less a favorite in society because she
was an engaged young lady, but she was more circumspect;
and certainly now Roger had nothing to complain
of. Only life seemed too short ever to make up the lost
months.
</p>

<p>
Annis was as happy as the lovers themselves. She was
very companionable and never in the way. There was a
curious ingrained delicacy about her. Dr. Collaston declared
he was jealous. He and little Bessy ought to outweigh
the regard for Mr. Carrington.
</p>

<p>
"But I knew him first. It's the longest friendship,"
glancing up archly.
</p>

<p>
"I have taken you to my heart and home&mdash;doesn't that
count? And Mr. Carrington has no home."
</p>

<p>
Annis was not prepared for that argument. She could
not seem ungrateful.
</p>

<p>
Spring came on apace. What a lovely season it was!
Beautiful wild flowers sprang up at the roadsides, the trees
and shrubbery put on infinite tints of green. The river,
really majestic then, making a broad lake after its confluence
with the eastern branch; the marshy shores, dotted
with curious aquatic plants that had leave to grow
undisturbed and bloom in countless varieties, if
not so beautiful; the heights of Arlington, with the
massive pines, hemlocks, and oaks, and flowering trees
that shook great branches of bloom out on the air like
flocks of flying birds, and filled every nook and corner
with fragrance. And as the season advanced the apricot,
pear, and peach came out, some of them still in a comparatively
wild state, finer as to bloom than fruit.
</p>

<p>
There lay pretty Alexandria, with the leisurely aspect
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_251' name='Page_251'>[251]</a></span>
all towns wore at that day. Great cultivated fields
stretched out as far as the eye could see. Diversified
reaches in hill and woodland broke the surface into a
series of beguiling pictures, as if one could wander on
for ever and ever.
</p>

<p>
And then, at the bend of the river, Mount Vernon in its
peaceful silence; a place for pilgrimages even at that time,
and destined, like Arlington, to become more famous as
the years rolled on. But while the former was shrouded
in reverent quiet, Arlington was the scene of many a gay
gathering. If Mrs. Madison sometimes wearied of the
whirl of pleasure so different from her Quaker girlhood
and early married life, the ease with which she laid
down the trappings and ceremonies of state and adapted
herself to the retirement of Montpellier showed that she
had not been wedded to the glitter and adulation, and
that the ease and comfort of country life were not distasteful
to her. While not a strongly intellectual woman, nor
the mother of heroes, there is something exquisitely
touching in her devotion to her husband's mother in her
old age, and then to her husband through the years of
invalidism. It seems a fitting end to a well-used life that
in her last years she should come back to the dear friends
of middle-life, still ready to pay her homage, and to the
new city that had run through one brief career, to be as
great a favorite as ever.
</p>

<p>
And now, when balls and assemblies began to pall on
the pleasure-seekers,&mdash;and one wonders, in the stress of
the war, how so much money could have been spent on
pleasure and fine-dressing,&mdash;excursions up the Potomac
to the falls, so beautiful at that time, were greatly in
vogue. Carriages and equestrians thronged the road, followed
by great clumsy covered wagons and a regiment of
slaves, who built fires and cooked viands that were best
hot, or made delicious drinks, hot and cold.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_252' name='Page_252'>[252]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
About fifteen miles above were the Great Falls. In the
early season, when spring freshets gathered strength and
power in the mountain range of the Alleghanies, the river
swelled by the affluents in its course, and bursting through
the Blue Mountains at Harper's Ferry, swept onward
with resistless force until it came to this natural gorge,
where it fell over a declivity of some thirty to forty feet.
Indeed, this was one of the great natural curiosities of the
time, and foreigners made the pilgrimage with perhaps as
much admiration as Niagara elicits from more jaded
senses.
</p>

<p>
Nearer the City, and convenient for an afternoon drive,
were the Cascades, some five or six miles above Georgetown&mdash;a
series of rushing streams divided by rocks, tumbling,
leaping, quivering in the sunshine, and sending out
showers of spray full of iridescent gleams and bits of
rainbows that danced around like fays in gorgeous robes.
Here merry parties laughed and chatted, ate, and drank
each other's healths, and tripped lightly to the inspiriting
music of black fiddlers, who threw their very souls as
well as their swaying bodies into the gay tunes.
</p>

<p>
Others, lovers most frequently, rambled about in the
shady dells and exchanged vows&mdash;gave promises that were
much oftener kept than broken, to their credit be it
said. Though at that time there was much merry badinage
and keen encounters of wits. Reading was not so
greatly in vogue; women spent no time at clubs or over
learned essays. "A new-fashioned skirt of emerald-green
sarcenet faced with flutings of white satin with pipings
of green, and a fine white mull tunic trimmed with
fringes of British silk, with green satin half-boots and
long white gloves stitched with green," filled many souls
with envy at one of the assemblies, says an old journal.
</p>

<p>
Patterns were borrowed, and poor maids sometimes
were at their wits' ends to copy them. Most households
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_253' name='Page_253'>[253]</a></span>
had two or three women who were deft with the needle,
and who were kept pretty busy attending to their mistresses'
wardrobes. Occasionally a happy blunder
brought in a new style. Privateers sometimes captured
cargoes of finery and smuggled them into some unguarded
port, and already manufacturers were beginning to copy
foreign goods with tolerable success.
</p>

<p>
As for the living, there was an abundance of everything
in the more southern provinces. Fruits of all kinds
seemed to grow spontaneously, crops were simply magnificent,
poultry, game, fish, and oysters were used without
stint. They were wise, these people who had not
drifted to the bleak New England shores, where the living
was wrested from the soil and consciences were not
yet sufficiently free to unite happiness with goodness.

<br />
<span class="s08">OF MANY THINGS.</span>
</h2>

<p>
"Oh, where is mamma?" cried Annis, as she was
clasped in Mr. Mason's arms one morning.
</p>

<p>
"Can't you give me mamma's welcome also?" inquired
the kindly voice. "Why, Annis, what a large girl you
are! It seems as if we must have been away an age for
you to change so."
</p>

<p>
"Am I changed?" She laughed cheerfully. "Isn't
it time I grew? Varina said in her last letter that she was
five feet four inches. And I am not five feet yet. And
Rene has been to assemblies, in long gowns. I went to
two balls, and that of the flags was&mdash;magnificent."
</p>

<p>
"I shall have to look after my flock more sharply.
You will all run wild."
</p>

<p>
"But mamma?"
</p>

<p>
Then he told her that although the operations had been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_254' name='Page_254'>[254]</a></span>
a success, and there was now no danger of Charles growing
crooked, he was still in a very delicate state of health,
and the doctor had ordered him a cool climate for the
summer. They were to go farther north and travel about
a bit. A sea voyage was supposed to be the best, but that
was quite impossible in the present state of affairs and
the dangers of the ocean.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I thought you were sure to come home!" she
exclaimed disappointedly.
</p>

<p>
"We are sure of nothing, it seems. Are you very
homesick?"
</p>

<p>
A quick rift of color flashed up in her face. "I'm not
homesick at all. I like Washington so much. There are
so many beautiful places, and the sails on the rivers and
queer nooks where the Indians used to live, and the Capitol
and the Senate where the great men talk, and so many
lovely people in fine clothes, and the officers, and the
French minister's carriage that spins along like a great
butterfly, and handsome Mrs. Madison and the grand
ladies&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You will hardly want to go back to the plantation."
</p>

<p>
"Jaqueline is going to live in Washington," she said,
evading the question.
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid you are getting off with the old love,"
half reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
"Not mamma, not&mdash;oh, I love you all just the same!"
clasping his arm vehemently.
</p>

<p>
Her cheeks were very bright. She experienced a curious
feeling about Charles. Perhaps it was because she
had seen these grown lovers so much, and she herself was
growing out of childish things.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Mason was on his way to the plantation, and then
to the Pineries. His mother had missed his visits very
much through the winter, and she was becoming more
feeble.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_255' name='Page_255'>[255]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
They all felt disappointed that Charles was not really
well.
</p>

<p>
"It is probably the best thing you can do," said Dr.
Collaston. "He needs bracing up after this trying ordeal.
I was afraid he would sink under it."
</p>

<p>
"The doctors consider it quite wonderful. When I
think how narrow his escape has been from lifelong deformity&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The father's voice broke a little. Not an hour ago he
had been talking to Louis, straight, tall, vigorous, with
clear eyes and skin pink with the rich blood coursing
through his veins; and the contrast between him and
the poor pale lad had been great indeed.
</p>

<p>
"It will be all right. Surgery is making rapid strides.
So is everything. I am glad not to be any older, and I
hope to live to see a great and grand country. Why, I
may reasonably count on fifty years!" laughing light-heartedly.
</p>

<p>
Yet he would have been shocked if he could have
looked at Washington fifty years from then&mdash;with a gift
of prescience.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Mason was gratified to meet Roger Carrington
again in the relationship to which he had once so cordially
welcomed him. Jaqueline was sweet and tender and
very happy. But what a fine young woman she had become!
And Patty was as matronly and motherly as if
she had been married half a century. But Randolph
Mason gave a little sigh as he thought how children grow
up and out of the old home nest.
</p>

<p>
The plantation was in good shape. There had been
some unimportant deaths, a number of marriages, and
many births. Virginia slaves were a prolific race, and
added to the wealth of the master. They were all overjoyed
to see him, and full of regret that "missus" wasn't
with him.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_256' name='Page_256'>[256]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"'Pears laik everybody been daid and buried but Mas'r
Louis," said old Chloe.
</p>

<p>
At the Pineries nothing seemed changed. Brandon
Floyd was beginning to look like his father, and was
taking on the same important airs. He was very bitter
about "Madison's war, that no doubt would last as long
as the other war, by the looks of things, and leave us in
the same plight."
</p>

<p>
When Mr. Mason thought of his own blooming girls
his heart really ached for Marian. After all, there was
nothing like a home of her own and a love of her own for
a woman. He was glad Jaqueline had come back to hers.
</p>

<p>
But it brought about a rather perplexing point, not so
easily settled, it would seem. Mr. Carrington importuned
for an early marriage. Jaqueline had bidden him
wait until her father came.
</p>

<p>
The lover pleaded his cause so well that the father
could hardly say him nay.
</p>

<p>
"What do you most desire?" to Jaqueline. "We may
not be back until quite in the autumn. I have been
seized with a strong inclination to see a little of our own
big land," laughingly. "We are proud of our share in
the old war, but other States had a hand in it as well. It
makes a man feel more a citizen of the whole country&mdash;and
a grand place it is. So we shall not hurry."
</p>

<p>
He gave her a wistful glance, as if to read her wish
in the matter.
</p>

<p>
"I would quite as lief wait. Everything would have to
be so different. But," blushing, "it was the rock on
which we went to pieces before."
</p>

<p>
Her father nodded.
</p>

<p>
"There would be great disappointment on the old place.
But you might go down and stay a week or so. Varina
is so in love with Dolly and Charleston that we settled
she should remain until autumn, when Dolly and her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_257' name='Page_257'>[257]</a></span>
husband are coming up for a visit. That young Floyd
seems to be quite somebody. I always thought Dolly
flighty, but she appears to have some common sense, after
all."
</p>

<p>
"And Varina is quite a woman. I hope she won't be
utterly spoiled. Of course," tentatively, "it would be
a quiet wedding. I think I would like it in church."
</p>

<p>
Then, she had really considered it.
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" said Patty. "So many of the girls
around home are married and gone, and unless you could
have a crowd it would be dismal. Then, you have so
many friends in Washington. To be sure, it would be
queer for a girl to be married without all her family about
her. Mamma and Charles and Varina! Well, we've
one more than half of them. Jaqueline, if you hadn't
made that fuss before&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," returned Jaqueline meekly.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Jettson added her voice in favor of the marriage.
It had to be so speedily arranged. There were friends
ready enough to be bridesmaids; indeed, the subject was
taken up in such earnest that Jaqueline was likely to be
married out of hand. All that was really needed was a
wedding gown and an appearing-out dress; all the rest
could be done afterward, and there was her mother's
bridal gown waiting for her.
</p>

<p>
When it came to the point, instead of a simple wedding
it was a very grand one. One of the Cabinet ladies sent
her a veil to wear because it was luck to be married in
something borrowed, and the veil had been worn at the
coronation of King George. Mrs. Sweeny worked night
and day altering over the wedding gown, which was a
mass of satin, sheer gauze, and lace, with a train carried
by a daintily attired page. Annis held her prayer book
and her glove when the ring was put on her finger.
Christ Church was crowded with the <i>élite</i> of Washington,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_258' name='Page_258'>[258]</a></span>
said a journal of the day. Mrs. Madison graced the
scene, and Mrs. Cutts, with whom Jaqueline was a great
favorite, while Judge and Mrs. Todd were warm in congratulations.
It was really quite an event, and Roger
felt almost as if he had married a princess of the blood
royal. Such parties and dinners as were showered upon
the young couple, and such compliments as the handsome
bride received, were almost enough to turn one's
head.
</p>

<p>
Annis was kept busy writing journal-like letters to
mamma and Charles. And what treasures the old journals
and letters are to-day! How Mrs. Carrington went
to Christ Church Sunday morning in "a violet satin gown
trimmed with fine silk ruffles edged with lace, and a white
satin petticoat with embroideries in violet silk and gold
thread. A fine-wrought lace scarf that her own mother
had brought from Paris, white satin boots with gold lacings,
long white silk gloves embroidered in lavender, and
a white Neapolitan hat with a wide fluted rim, trimmed
with a drawn silk lining and rows of piping, and a great
cluster of lilies and violets and ostrich plumes."
</p>

<p>
The wedding veil was returned. Annis was to wear
the wedding gown later on, and at a very modern entertainment
quite late in the century Jaqueline's grand-daughter
won no end of admiration in it.
</p>

<p>
So when Randolph Mason had given his eldest
daughter away, and kissed her good-by with a thousand
tender wishes, he went back to the pale little son and his
dear nurse, as if he had had some sort of a gala dream
mixed up with a whirlwind.
</p>

<p>
"I wish Jacky had waited," said Charles with a sigh.
"I should like to have seen it."
</p>

<p>
"It wouldn't have been half so grand at home. Washington
is a fine place for such a thing."
</p>

<p>
"Finer than Philadelphia?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_259' name='Page_259'>[259]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no!" Mr. Mason smiled, remembering the simple
church. There were grander ones here. And, except
the Capitol, the White House, and parts of several
public buildings, there was nothing so very grand. But
the concourse of people could hardly have been matched.
</p>

<p>
"Didn't Annis want to come with you?"
</p>

<p>
"She did at first. Then the wedding drove all other
desires out of her mind. I was afraid she would make a
time when I started. But everything was in such a
bustle!"
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't she have come here for a week or two, before
we start?"
</p>

<p>
"How would we have sent her back?"
</p>

<p>
"We wouldn't have sent her back then," said the boy
triumphantly.
</p>

<p>
His father smiled. "She has grown so, and changed
some way. Her hair is not quite so light. And she
can chatter in French like a native. Patty thinks her
very smart."
</p>

<p>
"And I have not grown any!" he subjoined in a disconsolate
tone. "I am not allowed to study. She will
get way ahead of me. But she doesn't know Latin, and
she can't go to college."
</p>

<p>
And perhaps he could marry her. He was not so sure
of that now. Perhaps he would never marry anyone.
But he was glad Roger Carrington had Jaqueline.
</p>

<p>
Annis tried very hard to be sorry at not seeing her
mother. She was frightened because she did not want
to cry over it as she had at first. She had given up
mamma to Charles, and to be sorry and want her back
was selfish. Then there were so many things to do, and
so many pleasures. There was not time enough to run
over to Aunt Jane's every day, yet the children were so
fond of her. She knew some girls, too, who were asking
her to supper every few days, or to join some party to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_260' name='Page_260'>[260]</a></span>
woods, or to sail up or down the river. It was such a
lovely thing to be alive and well! When that came into
her mind her very heart melted in pity for Charles.
</p>

<p>
Then, it was queer, but Louis had taken to calling her
his little girl. He teased her sometimes, but he came to
take her riding when she had any spare hours. She could
hardly decide which was the handsomer, Louis or Mr.
Carrington, and she thought it rather disloyal. Jaqueline
said Roger was, by far.
</p>

<p>
And then came the plans for housekeeping. Roger
and she inspected some houses. It would be more convenient
in Washington, but Georgetown was much prettier.
And there were suburban districts.
</p>

<p>
"But think of the winter nights in the rain and the
mud, and sometimes sleet, and the time wasted going back
and forth. Isn't it a bit of patriotism to want to build up
one's own city? We are a small people as yet, compared
to some other places. If we don't increase and multiply
and spread out, and fill up our vacant squares, our honor
may be taken from us."
</p>

<p>
"After so noble an argument I shall have to agree with
you that it is our bounden duty to remain," replied Jaqueline
with an arch smile.
</p>

<p>
"Mother would like us at Georgetown, but she has
Ralph and his wife."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, do stay!" cried Annis. "I like Washington so
much!"
</p>

<p>
"The casting vote. We remain. Annis, you are to
come with us. We couldn't give you up now."
</p>

<p>
"Until mamma comes home. Of course I belong to
her."
</p>

<p>
They went down to the old plantation, and the house
slaves made a big feast; the field hands had an illumination
of lanterns and big pine knots. But Annis thought
the great house lonely. Then she recalled what her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_261' name='Page_261'>[261]</a></span>
father once said&mdash;when all the children were married she
would stay there with her mother and him. Jaqueline
and Patty and Varina would have husbands and children,
and Annis shivered at a strange consciousness of solitude.
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline had been instructed to take her outfit, and
anything she wanted, her father said. Chloe knew all
about the bed and table linen: didn't she bleach it up every
spring in May dew? Such a packing, such a rejoicing
time over missy's husband "that she got at last," which
meant nothing derogatory nor that she had made a great
effort; only most of the slaves had great faith in first
loves for white folks, and a happy ending to an engagement.
</p>

<p>
There was the house to put in order and the "house-warming"
to give, a grand dinner for married friends
and a dance for the young people, when Louis was master
of ceremonies, and bright eyes grew still brighter with
pleasure at his notice.
</p>

<p>
Almost before one had noted, there were cool nights
and ripening foliage, house-cleaning, and preparation
for winter. Ah, how lovely the banks of the Potomac
were, and Rock Creek! Jaqueline begged that they
should take their first ride over again. There were various
first things to do. The mother over at Georgetown
claimed them frequently. Ralph's wife was very nice and
sweet, but Jaqueline brought a curious stir and dazzle in
the house, and an atmosphere as of a spring morning.
</p>

<p>
Charles had improved wonderfully. There were some
remarkable springs up the Hudson that had wonderful
health-giving properties. And when they came back to
New York he was so taken with the advantages that he
begged to remain. The doctor in whose charge he had
been, promised to watch over him and not allow him to
study too severely, and a nice boarding place had been
found for him with a charming motherly woman.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_262' name='Page_262'>[262]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Annis!" cried her mother, holding her off after
the first fond embrace, "let me look at you. I have lost
my little girl!"
</p>

<p>
"Mamma, I couldn't stay little always. But the part
that loves and thinks doesn't change, and I have tried
very hard sometimes not to want you when I knew Charles
needed you. I am so glad to get you back! Oh, you <i>do</i>
believe that? But there is a queer thing I don't understand.
When we first came to Virginia it was very hard
to try to love the others when they took so much attention."
</p>

<p>
She was studying her mother with large, earnest, lustrous
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Mrs. Mason, with a fond embrace.
</p>

<p>
"And now I love them all so much. I'm not quite sure
about Varina&mdash;I have not seen her in so long. But I
love you the best."
</p>

<p>
The mother kissed her fondly. No one, not even her
husband, who was so grateful for the sacrifice she had
made, knew how hard a trial it had been to her.
</p>

<p>
Just as they were considering whether they could
leave Annis at school and do without her, word came from
the Pineries. Mrs. Floyd had a sudden stroke, not so
very severe, but at her time of life a serious matter.
</p>

<p>
Young Mrs. Floyd and her husband and Varina came
North a few days after this. There was a month of slow
wasting away. Mrs. Brandon Floyd had a new baby,
Marian was almost worn out, and Mrs. Mason found herself
the comforter again, and much needed. Then grandmamma
slipped out of life, and was laid by the side of
Mr. Floyd; and Mr. Mason, seconded warmly by his wife,
insisted that Marian should spend the winter with them
and rest, perhaps make it her future home.
</p>

<p>
Varina was a tall, rather distinguished-looking girl who
had blossomed somewhat prematurely into womanhood.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_263' name='Page_263'>[263]</a></span>
Annis was still a little girl beside her. She was gay and
bright, and full of her own good times. Jaqueline's marriage
was delightful; they had enjoyed the account in the
paper. Charles was well again, but what a sad time it
had been for him! As for herself, she and Dolly were
the dearest of sisters, and had had the best of times. She
should coax papa to let her return to Charleston. She
knew so many people there, and it would be just horrid to
go back to the old plantation. There were all the others,
and surely papa could spare her.
</p>

<p>
Dolly was very exigent as well. Mr. Mason realized
that it would be dull for a young girl, with the household
in mourning, and Marian half an invalid and dispirited.
But he insisted upon a family gathering at Christmas, as
Charles was to come home.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Carrington would fain have had Roger and his
wife, and Mr. Brandon Floyd sent a formal invitation for
Jane and her family at the Pineries, but she chose the
Masons instead. Marian was pale and grave, but improving
under the fostering care of Mrs. Mason, who
was the kindest of sisters. Bessy Collaston had a new little
brother; and, with Dolly's one and Mrs. Jettson's four,
there was quite an array of children.
</p>

<p>
But the most joyous of all was the welcome to Charles.
Now he showed his real improvement. He had some
color in his cheeks and his eyes were bright and lustrous;
his voice rang with a clear sound.
</p>

<p>
Curiously enough, he seemed almost a stranger to Annis,
and not the little boy with whom she had poured over
Froissart. She had outgrown him; and as for Varina,
she patronized him in a most uncomfortable fashion.
They were all so glad to see him well once more that no
one thought of teasing him, even when he aired his new-found
knowledge unduly. Perhaps he was most flattered
by the friendliness of his big brother-in-law Roger.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_264' name='Page_264'>[264]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Then followed the dispersion. It was best that Annis
should stay at school the coming year, and Jaqueline
declared she could not do without her. Truth to tell,
what with her school friends and her various amusements,
Annis began to feel as if Washington was her real home,
and the plantation a place to visit. Her mother had so
many long-neglected duties to take up, and Marian to
nurse back to health and better spirits. She had done
without her little girl so long, and clearly this was to the
child's advantage.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the war had gone on with varying fortunes,
but the navy of the country had gained various accessions
by capture from the British and alterations from the
merchant vessels. None of the coast cities had been attacked.
Boston, New York, and Philadelphia had been
making their defenses more secure. There was a fine fort
at Baltimore. But Washington made no advances. Congress
wrangled over a hundred points. The country at
large was losing faith in the administration. There was a
growing party in favor of suing for peace on the best
terms we could get; another clique were quite certain we
would wear out England, as, after all, she had made no
real gains, and we had become quite formidable on the
high seas.
</p>

<p>
General Armstrong, secretary of war, was confident
Washington would not be attacked; and though he admitted
that defenses should be strengthened, very little
was done.
</p>

<p>
The downfall of Napoleon and his abdication, and the
peace with France, had released the flower of the British
army, and many warships. It was supposed Bermuda
was their objective point, but they were ready to harass
the coast line from Florida to Maine, and filled many of
the towns with apprehension.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_265' name='Page_265'>[265]</a></span>
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">IN THE MIDST OF WAR.</span>
</h2>

<p>
The summer of 1813 was destined to rouse the legislators
at Washington from their supineness. Some
fishermen discovered a large fleet of sail sweeping in between
the royal capes and settling at anchor, as if undetermined
what course to pursue. They gave the alarm;
and as the ships sailed up the Chesapeake, Baltimore was
believed to be the objective point.
</p>

<p>
Commodore Barney's little fleet was chased up the
Patuxent. General Armstrong's orders were to burn it
if there was danger of its falling into the hands of the
enemy. Then with his men he was to join General
Winder for the defense of Washington. The vessels
were fired without a single blow, and the men made a
forced march across the peninsula.
</p>

<p>
There were no forts for protection, and only a few hundred
regulars and several militia companies. With fatuous
obstinacy it was still believed Baltimore would take
the brunt of the attack, giving time to rally the troops to
the defense of Bladensburg if there should be an inland
march. All the adverse opinions and counsel delayed
what might have been done for the protection of the City.
</p>

<p>
But that August night, when the intentions of the
enemy were beyond all doubt, a courier spurred post-haste
over the heavy, sandy roads and through long
stretches of somber pines and giant oaks, a very prophet
of evil. At the little post-towns of Nottingham and
Marlborough the stentorian tones roused the people from
their sleep. "The British have landed at Benedict and
are marching inland. To arms! to arms!"
</p>

<p>
At Bladensburg he stopped at the ancient tavern, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_266' name='Page_266'>[266]</a></span>
the quiet town was thrown into a panic. Everybody was
called out for defense. Then on to Washington, and the
startled rulers looked into each other's faces in dismay.
And then Colonel Monroe admitted that though there
were no great treasures in Washington, the moral effect
of capturing the enemy's capital would be equivalent to
a greater victory. There were state papers that must be
at once sent to a place of safety, and those who had valuables
had better fly with them.
</p>

<p>
General Armstrong still believed no large army would
march forty miles from its base of supplies and run the
risk of being cut off, since Admiral Cockburn could not
know how well able the City was to defend itself.
</p>

<p>
All was wildest panic. Everything in the shape of cart
or wagon was loaded with cherished possessions, and the
road to Georgetown looked like a universal moving day.
</p>

<p>
It was decided to meet the enemy at Bladensburg and
oppose the march into Washington, if that was their object.
Everybody&mdash;a motley throng, indeed&mdash;was hurried
to the front, the women and children left to the care of
servants.
</p>

<p>
The Carrington household had for days been in the
deepest anxiety. A fortnight before Jaqueline's little
son had been born, to the great joy of them all. Mrs. Mason
and Marian had come up to the City&mdash;the first time
Marian had visited the place since her joyous girlish winter
and its ill-fated consequences.
</p>

<p>
All had gone on well, when a sudden and utterly unexpected
turn had filled them with alarm. A fever had set
in, and for several days it had been a fierce fight between
disease and skill, but there had grown up a faint hope in
the night, to be met with tidings of such terrible import.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Jettson had come, wild with affright.
</p>

<p>
"We are going at once," she said. "What can the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_267' name='Page_267'>[267]</a></span>
wretched little army do against four thousand trained
British soldiers? And Admiral Cockburn, it is said, has
sworn to be revenged for the treatment of the English
minister, and that he will compel Mrs. Madison to entertain
him and his staff at the White House. Can Jaqueline
be moved?"
</p>

<p>
"Only at the risk of her life," said Dr. Collaston. "All
the news has been kept from her, though she could not
have taken it in. I have sent Patty and the children
and some valuables over to Arlington. We must stay
here."
</p>

<p>
"But Marian and&mdash;Annis&mdash;can they not join us?" entreated
Jane.
</p>

<p>
"Annis will not leave her mother. Marian may be of
great service. She is a most excellent nurse. Even the
servants are panic-stricken, and cannot be depended on."
</p>

<p>
"Where is Roger?"
</p>

<p>
"At the capital. We men may be needed to defend
our homes. Admiral Cockburn is said to be ruthless.
General Winder has started for Bladensburg. Heaven
grant the battle may be decided there! But you had
better go at once, for the children's sake."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, poor dear Jaqueline!"
</p>

<p>
"We can only trust the very slender reed," and the
doctor's voice was husky with emotion.
</p>

<p>
"If I could do anything&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No, you cannot. Thank you for all your kindness
in the past."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Madison has been handed down by history as the
one serene figure in the turmoil and danger. She moved
quietly to and fro, securing valuables and state papers
and sending them away by trusty servants. The President
and several members of the Cabinet had started for
the scene of action.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Mason and Marian watched by the bedside with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_268' name='Page_268'>[268]</a></span>
minutest instructions, while the doctor went out on some
pressing business.
</p>

<p>
"A soger gemmen say he must see Miss Annis," announced
the new butler, who had been but a month in his
place. "I jus' done fergit de name. Dar's flustration
in de berry air."
</p>

<p>
"To see me?" asked the child in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"He want de doctor awful much. Den he say send
Miss Annis."
</p>

<p>
Annis held out her hand to Marian. "Come with
me!" she exclaimed. "We will not disturb mamma."
</p>

<p>
They went down together. The man in the hall was
covered with dust and grime, and purple-red with the
heat. A soldier, sure enough; but the first moment Annis
drew back.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, little Annis, don't be afraid!" and she knew the
voice. "Marian&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
And so the two met who had just touched their lips to
the cup of joy in the spring of youth. A grave woman
half a dozen years older, a man whose life might be ended
this very day. All these years he had been bitter and resentful,
but if he were dying&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Can you not fly at once? The battle has been disgraceful,
but what could such an army do against overwhelming
odds. The whole thing has been a piece of
shameful imbecility in our rulers. The British are
marching into Washington."
</p>

<p>
"Then you have not heard&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Something in Marian's tremulous voice awed him. He
wiped the sweat and grime from his face.
</p>

<p>
"I have not been in Washington for three months."
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Carrington is lying at the point of death."
</p>

<p>
Annis began to cry, and caught his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Then Heaven help you! No one can tell what the
end will be. Now I must away to warn all who can fly,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_269' name='Page_269'>[269]</a></span>
and then do the best we can to protect those who remain.
If possible, I will send a guard. Little Annis, good-by,
if I should never see you again."
</p>

<p>
She threw her arms about his neck with a convulsive
sob. He held out his hand to Marian, but neither spoke.
Then he rushed away. There was not a moment to lose.
He strode over to the White House, where all was still
uncertain, and Mrs. Madison had given orders for the
dinner. To procure wagons was a labor of love and
infinite persuasion, to say nothing of money.
</p>

<p>
Then the messenger came shouting that General Armstrong
had ordered a retreat. Daniel Carroll had sent
his carriage, but Mrs. Madison refused to go until the
President arrived.
</p>

<p>
"It will not do for you to fall into the hands of the
British," declared an officer. "That would crown the
triumph."
</p>

<p>
Pale and weary from his fruitless journey, the President
and his wife stepped into the carriage to be driven
across to Georgetown, where further difficulties awaited
them. The opposition journals made merry over the
undignified flight, yet there is no doubt but that it was the
aim of both the Admiral and General Ross to crown their
victory by the capture of the most conspicuous figures of
the Capital.
</p>

<p>
The British marched steadily on the heels of the flying
foe, leaving their dead and wounded exposed to the pitiless
sun, and proceeded at once to the Capitol, which
they ransacked and then set on fire, striking down anyone
who dared to raise a voice in its behalf. Then they
marched along Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House,
chagrined to discover only a few servants left, but gratified
to find a banquet awaiting them. There had been
covers laid for forty guests. Dishes of all kinds were
ready in the kitchen to be served. Wines were in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_270' name='Page_270'>[270]</a></span>
cooler, handsome cut-glass and silver trays of delicious
fruit stood on the sideboard. The hungry officers and
men, scorning ceremony, feasted until the place became
the scene of the wildest orgie. The wine cellar was
broken open and its contents passed around, rooms were
ransacked and combustibles piled up; and as they found
little worth carrying off, the match was applied, and the
house that had been the scene of so many joyous occasions
was soon in flames.
</p>

<p>
From thence to the Treasury Department, and then to
the office of the <i>National Intelligencer</i>, whose editor had
denounced Cockburn unsparingly for his acts of vandalism
on the coast and among defenseless towns; and the
houses of some of the more noted citizens were added to
the conflagration. Women flying for refuge were insulted,
wagons stopped and despoiled of their goods.
The few regiments could make no stand against the wanton
destruction.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly there came a strange darkness over the city.
From the far-off hills the wind began to roar like another
ravening army. There were sullen mutterings of thunder.
The order was given to retreat, and by the lurid
light the ranks re-formed, though many, wearied out,
straggled behind. The red blaze was made visible a moment
by the lightning, when the town seemed in a molten
glow, and then dense smoky blackness.
</p>

<p>
As if this was not enough, a frightful tornado seemed
hurled from the hills on the doomed City.
</p>

<p>
The roar of the elements was terrific. Trees were uprooted
and houses blown from their foundations, crashing
down in the general ruin.
</p>

<p>
All day they had watched between hope and fear.
Jaqueline's fever had abated, and she lay half unconscious.
After the soldiers marched into the City, and he had seen
Mrs. Madison started on her perilous journey, Roger
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_271' name='Page_271'>[271]</a></span>
felt he could be of no farther service. The enemy would
wreak his vengeance unopposed. He found there was
a guard in citizens' clothes keeping watch over his house
in an inconspicuous manner. But when the flames started
at the Capitol his anxiety was harrowing. What if they
should continue their work of devastation in this direction?
</p>

<p>
"Oh, do you think we shall all be burned up?" cried
Annis in terror, dreading the sight and yet running from
window to window.
</p>

<p>
No one could guess the power or purpose of the enemy.
And no one could measure nature's devastation.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Collaston was in and out. Jaqueline lay, unheeding
the tumult and danger.
</p>

<p>
"She does not really lose," he said. "Ross has gone
over to the White House. Oh, the poor doomed City!
And relief is needed for the wounded at Bladensburg.
Half the women are crazy at their husbands being
sent to the front. And all this might have been
avoided!"
</p>

<p>
Indeed, it transpired afterward that Mrs. Madison
had been refused shelter by a shrieking virago because
her husband had been enrolled for the defense of the
City.
</p>

<p>
"They are going to the White House. Perhaps they
may not molest us, after all."
</p>

<p>
This proved true. The ravages were continued over
eastward. They watched one building after another.
The public rope-walk was devoted to the flames. The
dockyards and arsenal and naval stores, powder magazine,
and a fine frigate just ready to be launched were
fed to the devouring element that roared in devastating
hunger.
</p>

<p>
But that seemed nothing to the tornado. Annis flew
to her mother's arms, and could not be pacified. Marian
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_272' name='Page_272'>[272]</a></span>
and Mrs. Mason would not go to bed, and Annis drowsed
with her head on her mother's shoulder, asking now and
then if morning had come.
</p>

<p>
It dawned presently over the ruined City. Rock Creek
was a rushing torrent. The Potomac had overflowed its
banks. Tiber Creek was swollen out of bounds. Cellars
were submerged, boxes and bales and furniture floated
out.
</p>

<p>
The British left their wounded behind, and when they
reached Bladensburg there were more than could be cared
for. Heartlessly trusting them to the mercy of the beaten
enemy, they marched on, striking terror to the smaller
towns through which they passed, and then attacking
Baltimore, the heroic defense of which is a matter of history.
General Ross was killed in the first skirmish, and
Admiral Cockburn forced to withdraw, and was condemned
even by his own government for his ruthless vandalism,
which had won nothing.
</p>

<p>
But the attack on Fort McHenry gave us one of our
most beautiful and deathless songs, and indeed seemed
the turning-point of misfortunes in a campaign that had
been conducted with so little foresight and sagacity. But
even this disaster may have been needed to bring the warring
factions together, and convince them that to keep a
country intact the strength of all is the salvation of each
one, of every home.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Collaston could hardly call it hope in the morning,
but Jaqueline had not lost anything through the terrible
night. Roger was nearly worn out with anxiety
and the work that had devolved upon him. Wounded
men were lying in the streets, and had been brought in
from Bladensburg.
</p>

<p>
"I must get a message over to Patty," the doctor said.
"The end of the bridge is burned, but there are some
boats. Something must be done for the relief of our poor
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_273' name='Page_273'>[273]</a></span>
men who turned out so bravely for the defense of our
homes."
</p>

<p>
Certainly it was a ruined city. Twenty years of labor
and interest and expenditure laid waste, many of the inhabitants
homeless, some lying wounded, not a few dead.
A deserted place, indeed; and it was not until the British
were before Baltimore that the panic really subsided.
</p>

<p>
The President and Mrs. Madison were among the earliest
to return. Mrs. Cutts opened her house, for the
White House was a charred and blackened ruin. Everybody
vied with attentions. The Tayloe mansion, called
The Octagon, on New York Avenue, and built in the
latter part of the preceding century, by a wealthy planter
of Mount Airy, was chosen for the present home.
Indeed, Mrs. Madison was never to go back to the White
House as its mistress, but she made a not less notable
center elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
Slowly people returned with their goods and stores.
The inhabitants of the adjacent towns were generous with
assistance. For a month or more Washington had a
continual moving-day.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the victories at Plattsburg and the surrender
of the fleet on Lake Champlain, as well as the signal
victory at Fort Bowyer, put heart into the Americans,
and England seemed not indisposed to discuss terms of
peace, convinced perhaps a second time that here was an
indomitable people, whose friendship was possible, but
whose conquest could never be achieved.
</p>

<p>
Slowly Jaqueline Carrington came back to life. The
intense heat had given way to cooling breezes, the sun was
often veiled by drifting clouds. For a week there were
alternations, then a steady improvement.
</p>

<p>
Temporary hospitals had been secured. Some of the
wounded had found shelter within their own homes or
those of friends.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_274' name='Page_274'>[274]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Louis came in one morning. He had been among the
volunteers so hastily enrolled, taken prisoner, and then
allowed to go, as General Ross did not want to be hampered.
</p>

<p>
"Collaston, has anything been heard of Ralston? He
came into Washington the morning of the battle. Now
that things are cleared up a little, he is reported missing.
The British did not stop to bury their dead, and he certainly
would have been noted."
</p>

<p>
"I thought it strange we did not hear. We must make
inquiries at once. We have been most fortunate, except
for pecuniary losses, and since Jaqueline is likely to be
restored to us we have no right to complain. I must set
out to find Ralston, though. The country has need of
such men."
</p>

<p>
It was true that Arthur Jettson and the doctor were
likely to be considerable losers by the misfortunes that
had overtaken Washington. But they were young, and
could recover. Patty and the two babies returned, and
she declared the losses were really not worth thinking of,
since everybody had been spared.
</p>

<p>
When Jaqueline was well enough to sit up a little, she
insisted on being taken to her favorite window, which
commanded a fine view of the City.
</p>

<p>
"While you have had one trouble, you have escaped
another," said her husband gravely. "Our beautiful
Washington&mdash;for it had grown beautiful to us, partly by
the eye of faith, I suppose&mdash;is no more. We have had
war and devastation of the elements, and must begin over
again. We can tell our children about Old Washington,
if she was not ancient in years; but a new one must arise
on its ruins."
</p>

<p>
"War!" Jaqueline cried in amazement. And then she
glanced at the destruction, bursting into tears.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, my darling wife. We have you and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_275' name='Page_275'>[275]</a></span>
boy, thanks to your mother and Marian and Dr. Collaston's
skill. He was faithfulness itself through all that
trying time. When you are stronger you shall hear the
whole story."
</p>

<p>
"And Louis&mdash;is everybody safe?"
</p>

<p>
"Louis shouldered a musket and marched like a trained
soldier. Oh, we have some brave men left, I assure you!
The enemy came; and what we were unable to do the
storm did&mdash;forced them to retreat before we had been laid
quite in ruins."
</p>

<p>
"It is terrible!" said Annis. "I have been driving
about with the doctor. The beautiful White House is
gone, and ever so many places. And the storm was terrific.
Oh, dear! what a horrible time it was! I sat up
all night long with mamma and Marian."
</p>

<p>
"Dear Marian! How good you have been to me!
You and mother have taken such excellent care of my
baby."
</p>

<p>
Marian glanced up with a grave smile.
</p>

<p>
"And no dear ones are lost? I suppose Lieutenant
Ralston was in the thick of the fight?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered her husband, "like many another
brave man. I think we owe him something also."
</p>

<p>
Everything was so changed. Marian often mused over
it. She felt like quite an old woman. She was hardly
likely to marry now. She had put her candle out, she remembered.
But her heart gave a quick gasp when she
thought of Ralston. "Evangeline" had not yet been
written, but daily she felt moved to enact the romance,
to go in search of him. Somehow she felt sure she could
find him. And if he was among the dead she would have
a right to cherish his memory, and that happy episode, the
one brief romance of her life.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Collaston came in. Yes, his patient was doing
nicely. When she could be moved with safety, the air
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_276' name='Page_276'>[276]</a></span>
of the old plantation, with its rich autumnal fragrance and
ripeness, would do her good. Patty should go with her
for a holiday.
</p>

<p>
Annis was hanging to the doctor's arm.
</p>

<p>
"Won't you take me out with you?" she said coaxingly.
"I like so to go with you, there are so many things
to see."
</p>

<p>
"I am going to take Roger out on a little business, if
everybody can spare him. Your turn may come to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
She nodded good-humoredly.
</p>

<p>
Carrington followed his friend downstairs. "We have
news about Ralston," the doctor said. "There is a messenger
here with tidings. There is no time to lose. You
can hear the story as we go along."

<p>
A pale, large-eyed young fellow with an anxious face
was awaiting them; and as they were driving over the
old road that had been traversed many a time in pleasure,
and was to be historic, Carrington listened to the young
man's tale. A British soldier, he had been wounded and
left on the field, and someone had paused to give him a
drink of water, when the stranger had been struck by a
stray shot and wounded in the leg. They had made their
way slowly to a deserted negro hut, where he had fainted.
His new friend had dressed his wound, which was more
painful than serious, but both were weak from exhaustion
and loss of blood. The storm coming on, they had
been glad of shelter. The next day his new-found
friend could not walk, and his leg was terribly swollen.
They waited in the hope that someone would find
them out. But on the third day the American was ill
and delirious. A negro woman had discovered them,
and visited them daily with food, and had attended to both
their wounds as well as she knew how. Now his companion
had come to his right mind, and he was a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_277' name='Page_277'>[277]</a></span>
Lieutenant Ralston. He had begged him, Eustace Stafford,
to find his way into the City and hunt up a certain
Dr. Collaston and tell him the story.
</p>

<p>
"He is still very ill," declared Stafford. "And he must
be taken out of that wretched hole at once. Still, we have
been very glad of the shelter."
</p>

<p>
"You look ill yourself&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You should have seen this young fellow half an hour
ago," declared the doctor. "You would have thought
him a ghost. He has a bad wound in his shoulder that
has not been properly treated, and healed up on the outside
too soon. I have a carriage here at the door. When
Patty heard the story she insisted that I should bring Ralston
home at once. We have plenty of room, and, after
all, have not been so hard hit."
</p>

<p>
Young Stafford, they found, had a cousin who was a
major in the English army. He had been quite enamored
of a soldier's life, had been attached to the staff, and was
a sort of private secretary to his cousin. But the romance
of war had been driven from his youthful brain by
his first battle, that of Bladensburg.
</p>

<p>
"But you must have better soldiers than those raw
recruits," he exclaimed, "when you have done such wonderful
things! Still, everything is so strange&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He glanced furtively at the two men, not knowing how
far it was safe to confess one's feelings. The ruin at
Washington had filled him with shame and dismay,
and he did not wonder that people on every hand were execrating
the British. Even the old negro woman had denounced
them bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"Most of our real soldiers were elsewhere. There is
a great stretch of country to protect. We have the Indians
for enemies, the French occasionally, but we shall
come out victorious in the end," said the doctor confidently.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_278' name='Page_278'>[278]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Where are the Admiral and General Ross?" asked
Stafford.
</p>

<p>
"At Baltimore now, where there is a prospect of their
being defeated. We were not prepared as we should
have been, to our shame be it said."
</p>

<p>
Then they lapsed into silence.
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid I have forgotten my way," the youth admitted
as they passed a partly overgrown branch road,
used mostly for the convenience of farmers. "I tried
to mark it by some sign. There was a tree that had been
struck by lightning. And a clump of oaks."
</p>

<p>
"There is a clump of oaks farther on."
</p>

<p>
"You see, that day&mdash;it was horrible with the groans of
the wounded and dying. And the awful heat! I tried to
crawl to a little stream, but fainted. And this soldier
came along presently, when I begged him for a drink."
</p>

<p>
"These are the oaks, I think," said the doctor, who
knew the road well.
</p>

<p>
"Then it is a little further on."
</p>

<p>
They turned into a cart-path. In a sort of opening
stood a blackened pine that had been grand in its day.
After several curves they left this road and soon found
the hut.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant Ralston was in a bad condition, indeed&mdash;emaciated
to a degree, his eyes sunken, his voice tremulous,
his whole physique so reduced that he could not
stand up. Stafford had made a bed of fir and hemlock
branches, and the little place was fragrant, if otherwise
dreary.
</p>

<p>
"We will not stop for explanations!" exclaimed the
doctor briskly. "The best thing is to get you to some
civilized place and attend to you."
</p>

<p>
"And the lad, too. I should have died without him
and poor old Judy. She will think the wolves have eaten
us, only she won't find any bones."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_279' name='Page_279'>[279]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
He was lifted carefully into the carriage, and they
journeyed homeward as rapidly as circumstances would
permit. Patty had cleared the sitting room on the lower
floor, and a cot had been spread for Ralston. They laid
the fainting man upon it, and the doctor proceeded to
examine his injuries.
</p>

<p>
The bone in the leg had been splintered, and a jagged
wound made. Judy's simples had kept it from becoming
necessarily fatal, but the fever and the days that had
elapsed rendered it very critical.
</p>

<p>
"I only hope he won't have to lose his leg," said Roger.
"That would be terrible to him."
</p>

<p>
"We will try our utmost."
</p>

<p>
It was a painful operation, but at last it was over.
Then Stafford's shoulder was looked after, and had to be
probed. Roger proved an invaluable assistant.
</p>

<p>
"We may as well have a hospital ward, and let the
enemy and the patriot lie side by side. They can't fight,
and I do not believe either of them has the vigor for a
quarrel." So another cot was brought in. Patty was
quite important, and full of sympathy for Ralston.
</p>

<p>
It was mid-afternoon when Carrington returned, and
they were all anxious to hear the story. For Jaqueline's
sake he made as light of it as possible, dwelling considerably
upon the heroism of both men, "although the
English lad is a mere boy, not twenty yet. What distorted
ideas they get over the water!" nodding his head. "As
if we had not been of one race in the beginning, equally
courageous, equally proud and resolute, and animated by
the same love of liberty. Think how they have waged
war with tyrants and wrested rights from kings!"
</p>

<p>
Marian waylaid him in the hall.
</p>

<p>
"I was listening inwardly to what you did not say," she
began tremulously. "Does the doctor think he <i>will</i> recover?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_280' name='Page_280'>[280]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"He is in a bad way, of course. But the leg is the
worst feature. Oh, let us all hope! Things have gone
so well with us that I am filled with gratitude, and cannot
despair."
</p>

<p>
Marian's eyes were downcast, her face pink to the very
roots of her hair; and her lips quivered.
</p>

<p>
That evening Roger was sitting beside his wife
alone, caressing the thin hand that returned the fond
pressure.
</p>

<p>
"Marian is in love with Philip Ralston," he began
abruptly. "Jaqueline, can't you think of the magic
touch that will bring these two together? You found it
easy enough before."
</p>

<p>
"And bungled and made no end of trouble," she returned
with a sad smile.
</p>

<p>
"It was old Mr. Floyd who made the trouble. Why
couldn't he have given his daughter to the young fellow
who loved her? What I am afraid of now is that he has
ceased to care. Still, he has been a favorite with women,
and no one has captured him. An attractive man has to
quite run the gauntlet. And when he thinks a woman's
love has failed&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Do you speak from experience?" inquired Jaqueline
archly, her eyes in a tender glow.
</p>

<p>
"Yes." There was a rising color and a half-smile hovering
over his face. "It <i>is</i> true that hearts are caught in
the rebound."
</p>

<p>
"But no one caught you."
</p>

<p>
"Because, month after month, I waited. I said at first,
'She will marry Ralston.' Then there were other admirers&mdash;you
know there were a host of them more attractive
than I, but I could have forgiven you for marrying Ralston.
If it had been someone else I should have turned
bitter, and that would have been the danger-point. I
might have wanted to convince you

<p>
paraphrasing an old ballad and substituting her own
name, while she glanced up laughingly.
</p>

<p>
"Since we found the making-up process so delightful,"
returned Jaqueline, "we are anxious to pass it around.
You see, now, Marian has no interest in life but to play
the part of maiden aunt. Jane will absorb a good deal
of her with the most generous intentions. She is a lovely
nurse, and I think grandpa's and Mr. Greaves' influence
has mostly died out. They were both so narrow and
dogmatic about women that they reduced her to a
sort of slavery. Mamma has brought her out to a
sense of freedom. Single women may be heroic, yet,
as I remember, the Revolutionary heroines were married
and mothers, most of them, and it is the wife and mother
who has the most exquisite happiness."
</p>

<p>
"What a long speech! We will try and get Ralston
well, and then trust good-fortune. There will be no one
to interfere this time."
</p>

<p>
While Ralston lay tossing on a bed of pain, his leg
in splints and bandages, events moved on rapidly. The
bold exploits and undying courage that had won such
brilliant successes on the seas had settled the question of
sailors' rights. England virtually admitted this while
still haggling with commissioners. And from having no
position among nations, from being considered feeble and
disunited, and possessing no innate right to establish a
commerce of her own, the United States had won the respect
of the countries abroad, and to a great degree harmonized
the jarring factions at home.
</p>

<p>
The crowning battle of the war was that of New Orleans,
with Jackson's brilliant victory, though some of the
preliminaries had been settled before this.
</p>

<p>
And one day a messenger came rushing into town,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_282' name='Page_282'>[282]</a></span>
swinging his three-cornered hat in one hand and holding
the bridle-rein in the other, and cried out in stentorian
tones, "Peace! peace! Peace has been declared! Mr.
Carroll, American messenger, has arrived with the Treaty
of Peace!"
</p>

<p>
In spite of blackened ruins and heaps of débris, there
was a great time in Old Washington. For, indeed, it
seemed old now, since it could boast of ruins. Flags
were hung out. Neighbors called to one another. Then
a coach came thundering along the avenue, another and
yet another, and stopped at the Octagon House. Congress
presented themselves, at least all who could be gathered
on a short notice, to take the news to the President,
who had suffered considerably from the exposure and fatigue,
and perhaps from the mortification of having been
a fugitive flying from the enemy.
</p>

<p>
The circular vestibule, the white winding stairway
that was open to the top, and the drawing room to the
right were crowded with guests, felicitating their chief
and one another. Animosity, coldness, and blame were
forgotten. Peace! peace! like the refrain of some sweet
music, went floating around all the space, and Mrs. Madison
was much moved with emotion. Strong men thanked
God with softened hearts. The conflict was over, and
now they knew the bitterness of war.
</p>

<p>
For this year young Daniel Webster was in the House,
and Clay and Calhoun and men who were to have much
to do with the nation's destinies later on.
</p>

<p>
Houses were illuminated, tar barrels were burned, and
the streets seemed fairly alive with people. Voices rang
with joy.
</p>

<p>
True, the Treaty was to be discussed and signed, the
British troops were to go home, the news to be carried
about on the high seas. Ports were to be opened, and
"Madison's nightcaps"&mdash;barrels that had been hung to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_283' name='Page_283'>[283]</a></span>
protect the rigging of ships&mdash;were removed with shouts
of joy.
</p>

<p>
There was a lull in Europe. Prussia drew a long
breath. Russia plumed herself on giving the famous
Corsican his first blow, while the Battle of Waterloo was
the last. France had a king of royal blood again. Spain
was repairing her fortunes; while England was counting
up her losses and gains, and preparing to shake hands in
amity with the young country across the ocean and grow
into friendship with it.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">THE OLD STORY EVER NEW.</span>
</h2>

<p>
Jaqueline Carrington's heart ached the first
time she was taken out to drive, when destruction met
her on every side. There was another sorrowful aspect.
Men were getting about on crutches, sitting on the Capitol
steps sunning themselves. There was an empty coat-sleeve,
some scarred faces, others pale and wan. Yes,
they had all escaped marvelously.
</p>

<p>
She thought herself the happiest woman in the world.
No one, she was quite sure, had such a tender and devoted
husband or splendid baby. Mother Carrington found
her affections quite divided, and the days when Jaqueline
came over to Georgetown were gala days.
</p>

<p>
True, Preston Floyd had been already talked of as a
member of the House of Representatives. Roger Carrington
had been appointed to an excellent position in the
Treasury Department, though he was still a great favorite
with Mr. Monroe, and Jaqueline was not jealous.
Arthur Jettson had come to be consulting architect, and
had still greater plans for the new city. Annis had resumed
her school, but she was quite an important little
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_284' name='Page_284'>[284]</a></span>
body, and sometimes her mother felt almost as if she had
lost her.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant Ralston found himself an admired hero.
He had been cool and level-headed through those days of
the panic; and it was admitted that many of his plans for
the defense of the City would have been excellent. A
new commission was made out, bearing the name of
Captain Ralston; and a position was ready for him,
when he could fill it, where his genius would have full
scope.
</p>

<p>
There were many anxious days over his leg. One of
the doctors said the wound would never heal, and that
presently it would be amputation or his life, and considered
the delay a great risk.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Collaston," he begged, "don't have me going
around on a wooden stump! If I was an admiral, now, I
shouldn't mind it, as it would add to the glory. But a
poor fellow who can't retire on his fortune&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"We'll fight to the very last, Phil. If you could have
been found sooner!"
</p>

<p>
"And some poor fellows were found altogether too
late. Well, the country has learned a lesson, and perhaps
with Paul Jones we have taught other nations a lesson,
not to tread on us! Do your very best."
</p>

<p>
The doctor did it in fear and trembling. For if he cost
his patient his life, he knew it would be a great blow to his
reputation.
</p>

<p>
As for the young lad, he soon began to improve. He
seemed quite stranded, for his cousin's regiment had re-embarked
and was coasting southward. No inquiries
had been made about him&mdash;indeed, he knew afterward
that the cousin had written home that he had been killed
at the Battle of Bladensburg and buried on the field. He
was a stranger in a strange land.
</p>

<p>
Ralston had grown very fond of him, and he proved
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_285' name='Page_285'>[285]</a></span>
himself an excellent companion. He was one of quite a
large household, and his father was a baronet, Sir Morton
Stafford. One brother was in the army at home, one in
the Church, two sisters were married, and there were four
younger than himself to provide for. As soon as he
could use his arm he wrote to his father, and Dr. Collaston
said cordially, "Consider my house your home until you
hear."
</p>

<p>
"You are very good to take in a stranger this way," he
returned with emotion.
</p>

<p>
Marian remained with Jaqueline when Mrs. Mason
went home.
</p>

<p>
"I have been such a gadabout of late years," Mrs.
Mason said, "that father hardly knows whether he has
a wife and a home. I must think a little of him."
</p>

<p>
"I wish you <i>could</i> stay, mamma!" pleaded Annis.
"Why can't you move up to Washington? I like it ever
so much better. There is so much to see and to do, and
we are all together here."
</p>

<p>
"There is Charles. And Varina."
</p>

<p>
"But Patty and Jaqueline and the babies seem like a
great many more. And the rides and drives&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But you have your pony. And papa would take you
any time with him."
</p>

<p>
"I like the crowds of people, and the pretty ladies in
their carriages, and the foreign ministers are so fine, and
to hear the men when they talk in the House, and the girls
give little parties. Oh, mamma, I love you, and I want
you here, but&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Her mother smiled. Yes, life on the plantation was
dull. And the jealous little girl was being weaned away.
</p>

<p>
"We are losing our children fast," she said to her
husband.
</p>

<p>
Marian and Jaqueline by slow degrees slipped into the
interchange of thought that real friendship uses. It had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_286' name='Page_286'>[286]</a></span>
not the girlish giddiness of youth; both had learned more
of the realities of life.
</p>

<p>
"But did you ever love Mr. Greaves, Marian?" Jaqueline
ventured one afternoon, as she sat with her baby on
her lap. He was so lovely that she envied the cradle
when she put him in it, and liked to feel his soft warm
body on her knees.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't at first. Oh, Jaqueline, brother Randolph is
so different from father! We never begged or teased or
coaxed things out of him as you children used to. And
mother expected us to obey the instant we were spoken
to. Then&mdash;I did not know that Lieutenant Ralston had
been up until some time afterward. Dolly found out that
he had been insultingly dismissed. Papa questioned me
about the acquaintance and my visit to brother's, and was
awfully angry. Jack, <i>did</i> you plan it?"
</p>

<p>
"I put things in train, simply. I did not know how
they would come out."
</p>

<p>
"Papa accepted Mr. Greaves for me. I meant to tell
him the story and decline his hand. But it was quite impossible.
I could never talk freely to him. He did not
ask me if I loved him. He had certain ideas about wives.
But he was gentlemanly and kind, and I had no liberty at
home. I began to think it would be nice to be free, to go
out without watching, to write a letter, to have some time
of my very own. I had said to papa that I would never
marry him, and he replied that I should never marry anybody,
then. Suddenly I gave in. I begged papa's pardon
for all the dreadful things I had said, and accepted Mr.
Greaves as my future husband. But I felt as if I had
been turned into stone, as if it was not really my own self.
That self seemed dead. I went round as usual, and tried
to take an interest in everything, but nothing really mattered.
Did you think me queer and strange that Christmas?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_287' name='Page_287'>[287]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"You certainly were cold, apathetical."
</p>

<p>
"That is just the word. Papa was formal and dogmatic
and arbitrary,&mdash;poor papa! it is unfilial to say these
things about him,&mdash;but mamma always seemed to get
along. Mr. Greaves was more gentle, and used to ask
what I would like; and I do believe he loved me; pitied
me; and I couldn't help feeling grateful. Then when
he had the first stroke papa said it would be dishonorable
to withdraw, and he should be very angry if
I contemplated such a thing. Dolly's marriage was on
the carpet. She seemed so young, so&mdash;yes, silly," and
Marian half hid her blushing face. "Could I ever have
been so silly, Jaqueline?"
</p>

<p>
"We all go through the rose-path of sweetness when
we are in love," returned Jaqueline. "I'm silly myself
at times. Marian, did you know that Mr. Ralston wrote
again?"
</p>

<p>
"Wrote again&mdash;then he did not forget?" She raised
her soft eyes, suffused with exquisite surprise.
</p>

<p>
"He wrote when he thought you were free again. I
always felt sure you did not get the letter. He took some
precautions, and was confident you must have had it,
though grandpa returned it without a word!"
</p>

<p>
"I never heard from him. Jane said when your
engagement was broken&mdash;" Marian paused and
flushed.
</p>

<p>
"That he would marry <i>me</i>."
</p>

<p>
Marian nodded. It had given her a heartache, she remembered.
So long as he married no one he did not
seem so completely cut off that she must cast him utterly
out of her life.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you see he did not. I think now I could not
have married anyone but Roger, if I had waited ten
years."
</p>

<p>
"Then, you know, came Mr. Greaves' death and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_288' name='Page_288'>[288]</a></span>
father's, and mother's failing health. I feel quite like an
old woman."
</p>

<p>
"At five-and-twenty! Nonsense! See how young
mamma is!"
</p>

<p>
"She is lovely, Jaqueline!" with enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what papa would do without her."
</p>

<p>
What a beautiful thing it was to be so dear to anyone
that he or she could not do without you!
</p>

<p>
"You saw Ralston that dreadful morning?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes." Marian buried her face in her hands. Some
feeling of unknown power connected with her youth shook
her, thrilled her; yet she strove to put it aside. "I
prayed I might not go back to that time," and her voice
was tremulous; "then when we all thought him dead
I&mdash;I let myself go. It is shameful for a woman when a
man has forgotten her."
</p>

<p>
"He has made tremendous efforts to forget&mdash;I know
that," and the sound like a smile in her voice made Marian's
face crimson again. "But I am sure he has not
succeeded any better than Roger did. And if he should
be unfortunate for life&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Then I should want to go to him. No one has any
right to order my life now. Would it be very unwomanly?"
</p>

<p>
"No. And you must go to Patty's. She thinks it so
queer, but I said you hated to leave me. Marian, if it
comes a second time you will not refuse?"
</p>

<p>
"I think I hadn't the courage to really refuse the first
time," and she smiled.
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline had more delicacy than to repeat what Annis
had said, and had forbidden her to carry anything like
gossip, "for a little girl who gossips will surely be an old
maid. And you will want a nice husband, I am certain."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes!" cried Annis. "And a lot of pretty babies."
</p>

<p>
"Then never carry tales."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_289' name='Page_289'>[289]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"But he is always asking me about Marian, and why
she doesn't come?"
</p>

<p>
So they sent word they might be expected on a certain
day, and baby and nurse and Annis, as soon as school
closed.
</p>

<p>
How many times, lying here, Philip Ralston had lived
over that sweet, foolish, incomprehensible love episode&mdash;the
obstinate regard, the indignation that had followed it,
the hard thrusts with which he had pushed her out of his
memory. She had gone only momentarily. Her sweet
youth had been spent in devotion to her self-indulgent,
inexorable father,&mdash;he knew how acrimonious Mr. Floyd
could be,&mdash;and, then, her stern, rigid mother. Had they
taken all her sweetness? He had half looked for some
sign when she had finished all her duties. Mrs. Jettson
had outlived the romance of it, and lost patience with
Marian. Besides, she was absorbed with her own family.
There were so many pretty girls, and Marian was getting
to be quite an old maid, in the days when girls married so
young.
</p>

<p>
And when he had met her that eventful morning he
had probable death before him, and was tongue-tied.
Did she think he had forgotten all?
</p>

<p>
They trooped in together, Patty leading the procession;
Jaqueline, still a little pale, but lovelier than ever, with her
boy in her arms, and Marian with the lost youth back of
her. She was too sincere to affect astonishment; and
he had improved&mdash;was neither so gaunt nor so ghastly as
when he first came. She took his hand&mdash;did she make a
confession in the pressure? He felt suddenly self-condemned,
as if he had misjudged her some way, and humble,
as if he had nothing good enough to offer her. But
he glanced up in the soft eyes&mdash;her life had not been
very joyous, she was by no means a rich woman, and if
she cared most for home and happiness&mdash;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_290' name='Page_290'>[290]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
She did not hear what they were saying at first. There
was a sound as of rushing water in her ears.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes!" he answered, with an hysterical laugh, "I
am to keep my own two legs to go upon. I owe it all to
Collaston, who stood between me and surgeons' knives,
and brandished his war club until they retreated. I shall
lie here in supreme content until he bids me arise and
walk."
</p>

<p>
What was it went over Marian's face. Not disappointment,
but an inexplicable tenderness, as if she could
have taken up the burden cheerfully, as if she were almost
casting about for some other burden.
</p>

<p>
"Poor girl!" he said to himself; "she has devoted her
sweetest years to others, and someone ought to pay her
back in love's own coin."
</p>

<p>
Stafford had improved greatly and gained flesh. He
had a fair, rather ruddy English complexion and light
hair, with the unusual accompaniment of dark-brown
eyes; and, though rather unformed, had a fine physique,
which was as yet largely in the bone, but would some day
have muscle and flesh.
</p>

<p>
The loss and ruin of Washington had been news to
Ralston, though he had known the march of the vandals
was inevitable. Annis interested and amused him in
her talk. She was a very pronounced patriot in these days.
</p>

<p>
Eustace Stafford seemed quite bewitched with her. He
came over every afternoon to bring word of Ralston, and
perhaps to have an encounter of words with Annis. This
day, while there were so many to entertain his friend, he
stole off to school to walk home with her, though there
was not a cloud in the sky that could give him a shadow
of excuse.
</p>

<p>
She was going to walk some distance with one of her
mates. "Perhaps it would tire you," she said mischievously.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_291' name='Page_291'>[291]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I have been in the house all the morning," was the
reply.
</p>

<p>
"Did they bring the baby? It's the most beautiful
baby in the world, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"I haven't seen all the babies in the world&mdash;" a
little awkwardly.
</p>

<p>
"But he ought to be able to tell whether one is pretty
or not, oughtn't he, Eliza?"
</p>

<p>
Eliza, thus appealed to, hung her head and said, "Perhaps&mdash;"
frightened and yet delighted to comment on
a young man's taste.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps British babies are different," was Annis'
rather teasing comment.
</p>

<p>
"I think babies are a good deal alike&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No, they are not," and she put on a pretty show
of indignation. "I think you are not capable of
judging."
</p>

<p>
"I am sure I am not," he said with alacrity. "They're
kept in a nursery at home, you know, and have a playground
out of the way somewheres."
</p>

<p>
"I am very glad I am not an English child, aren't you,
Eliza? Poor things! to be stuck out in a back yard!"
</p>

<p>
"My aunt and cousin are going to England as soon as
traveling is safe," said Eliza, with a benevolent intention
of pouring oil upon the troubled waters. "He is
going to some college."
</p>

<p>
"There are fine colleges in England. There are very
few here."
</p>

<p>
"We haven't so many people. Charles&mdash;that's my
brother&mdash;went through Harvard, which is splendid, when
he was spending some time in Boston. And he may
go to Columbia. That's in New York, where he is at
school."
</p>

<p>
"New York is a large city. The English held it in
the Revolutionary War."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_292' name='Page_292'>[292]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"But they had to march out of it," said the patriot.
"And they had to march away from Baltimore. And
now they will have to march away from the whole United
States, after they have done all the harm they could and
killed off the people and almost murdered poor Lieutenant
Ralston."
</p>

<p>
"But that is war. I'm sorry there should ever be war.
I wouldn't have it if I was a king. But your people declared
war," remembering that.
</p>

<p>
"How could we help it, when our poor sailors were
snatched from their own vessels and made to fight against
us or be beaten to death? Do you suppose we can stand
<i>everything</i>? We were altogether in the right, weren't
we, Eliza?"
</p>

<p>
Eliza glanced furtively at the very good-looking face,
scarlet with anger and mortification, and wondered how
Annis could get in such a temper with him.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know about the causes of war," she said hesitatingly.
"Some people blame Mr. Madison&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"There are Tories always. I've heard papa tell how
many there were in the Revolutionary War. But, you
see, we wouldn't have won if we had not had right on our
side," she added triumphantly.
</p>

<p>
"But Napoleon won in a great many battles," Stafford
ventured.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps he was right <i>then</i>," with emphasis.
</p>

<p>
This casuistry nonplussed the English boy. If Annis
wasn't so sweet and pretty&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Eliza had to say good-by reluctantly.
</p>

<p>
"Let us go this way," proposed Annis.
</p>

<p>
"This way" brought them to the defaced and injured
Capitol. Annis' scarlet lip curled.
</p>

<p>
"It is a shame," he acknowledged. "And&mdash;if it will
do you any good, I'm awfully sorry that I came over to
fight. But, you see, we don't understand. So many people
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_293' name='Page_293'>[293]</a></span>
think that after all England did for the Colonies, they
had no right to rebel, and that she still has some
claims&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"All she did!" exclaimed the fiery censor. "She persecuted
the Puritans, and they came over to a horrid wilderness.
She took New York away from the Dutch.
And she sent shiploads of convicts over to Virginia to be
a great trouble to the nice people who had grants of land.
And she said we shouldn't trade anywhere&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"If the heads of government could understand; or if
the people could see how fine and heroic and noble the
Americans are, I think they would refuse to come over
and fight them. I am glad they are going away. And
when I get home I shall tell everybody how brave they
are, and of the splendid homes they have made. And perhaps
if Captain Ralston hadn't stopped to give me a
drink and bandage my wound he might have found a better
place of refuge. I know <i>my</i> father will be grateful,
for I think he saved my life, and came mighty near losing
his own. I shall always be glad I didn't really
fight. I was struck before I fired my musket. And Dr.
Collaston is just like a brother. I like you all so. I shall
hate to go away." The words poured out with confused
rapidity.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you will have the courage to tell the truth,"
she replied severely. "I have heard that some of the
English think we are black, like the slaves they brought
over to us. And, do you know, they have been stealing
them again and carrying them off to the Bermudas. Or
they believe we have turned into wild Indians."
</p>

<p>
"They don't know," he said again weakly.
</p>

<p>
"Wasn't Mr. Adams over there a long while&mdash;and the
great Mr. Benjamin Franklin, and Mr. Jay, and ever so
many others? We send a minister to them&mdash;not a real
preacher," in a gracious, explanatory way that made her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_294' name='Page_294'>[294]</a></span>
more fascinating than ever, "but to discuss affairs; so
they ought to know whether we are black or white."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, they do at court! If I could make you understand&mdash;"
his boyish face full of perplexity.
</p>

<p>
"I think I <i>do</i> understand when I see Washington in
ruins. And I shall be glad when every Englishman goes
back. We don't go over to England and burn and destroy."
</p>

<p>
He had a vague idea there was something to be said for
his side, but he did not just know what. It seemed rather
ungrateful, too, as he was a pensioner on the hospitality
of her brother-in-law. It was extremely mortifying,
since his cousin had been intrusted with money for him.
So he was silent, but that did not suit the little lady, who
enjoyed the warfare like a born soldier.
</p>

<p>
She was always "saving up" disgraceful incidents she
heard, to tell him.
</p>

<p>
"You are pretty hard on the young fellow," Roger
said to her one day. "We must forgive him a good deal
for his devotion to Ralston."
</p>

<p>
"But think how you and doctor brother went out and
gathered up the wounded, and there were some British
among them as well. <i>He</i> ought to be very grateful."
</p>

<p>
"I think he is. And he is a nice lad."
</p>

<p>
Their skirmishes were very amusing to the family.
Patty really admired the young fellow, he seemed
such a big, innocent-hearted boy; but she enjoyed posting
Annis as to her side of the argument.
</p>

<p>
"Are you going?" Captain Ralston said to Marian
as they were making preparations for departure.
</p>

<p>
"You&mdash;you do not need me," she murmured as, holding
her hand, he drew her down nearer the pillow.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose everybody else does," he declared pettishly.
"You never considered me. You did not really
care&mdash;"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_295' name='Page_295'>[295]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
There were tears in her eyes as she tried to turn away.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps when the others are all dead and gone, and I
am an old man, you may remember what you confessed
those two blessed days. Or you may recall it over my
grave."
</p>

<p>
"I deserve it all," she returned meekly. "I tried&mdash;oh,
yes, I did; but I <i>was</i> weak&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Is it too late to go back?"
</p>

<p>
"Come, Polly!" cried Jaqueline. Sukey, the general
factotum at the Carringtons', called Marian "Miss
Polly." "Can't be boddered wid no sech outlandish name
as Miss Ma'yan&mdash;dat kinks my tongue up like a bit a
'yalum,'" she declared.
</p>

<p>
"Polly&mdash;you will come to-morrow?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;yes," with a scarlet face. "If you want me."
</p>

<p>
"I want you. I have a great deal to say to you."
</p>

<p>
But it took many to-morrows to get it all said. There
were rough places and doubts, intensified by the experiences
Ralston had gone through, and the nervous strain
of not only the long illness, but the almost certainty there
had been at one time of his losing his leg. That danger
was really over, but a great deal of carefulness had to be
observed. And few indeed can bring back the sparkle
to the cup of youth, when the freshness is no longer there.
</p>

<p>
Marian grew more girlish, as if the hands of time were
running the other way. The force that had impelled her
to middle life was removed. She had gained a certain
experience, quite different from the man who had been
mixing with the world. But what mattered when they
came back to the level of love?
</p>

<p>
Congress held its session at Blodgett's Hotel. It is true
there were heated discussions on the terms of peace, contradictions,
and dogmatic assertions. Perhaps the meetings
at the Octagon House, and the sweet, affable mistress
had much to do with softening asperities. Everybody,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_296' name='Page_296'>[296]</a></span>
it seemed, came, and it was conceded that we had
gained a good deal in the respect of foreign nations.
Commerce took on a brisk aspect. War vessels came into
port, and though they did not lay aside all their defenses,&mdash;for
the high seas were still infested with privateers,&mdash;they
took on the cargoes of industry instead of munitions
of war. It was found now that we had made strides
in manufacturing ordinary goods, though women were
delighted with the thought of once more procuring silks,
satins, velvets, and lace without extraordinary risks.
</p>

<p>
Eustace Stafford spent much of his time exploring
Washington, taking long walks and numerous drives with
the doctor. The beautiful Potomac, the towns along its
edge, the falls that in a cold spell had just enough ice to
make them wonderful and fairy-like, Port Tobacco that
had once been a thriving place, the inlets and creeks and
the fine and varied Virginia shore, and the magnificent
Chesapeake dotted with islands. And there was Annapolis,
destined to grow more famous as years went on.
</p>

<p>
He had not half explored the country when word
came from his father, inclosing a draft to bring him home
and reimburse the friends who had sheltered him with
such cordiality.
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry enough to leave you," he said with deep
emotion. "I feel like becoming an out-and-out American,
but I shall never be a soldier."
</p>

<p>
"Not in case of necessity?" said Patty with charming
archness.
</p>

<p>
"Of course if I had a home here I should defend it
to the last drop of blood in my veins&mdash;yes, even against
my own kindred," and he blushed with a feeling akin to
ardent patriotism that surprised himself. "I think we
only need to understand each other's governments better
to be good friends. There is something grand here. It
may be the largeness of everything, and the aspirations,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_297' name='Page_297'>[297]</a></span>
the sense of freedom, and&mdash;well, that certain equality.
You are not bound about by rigid limits."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Carrington said Stafford must go to one levee,
though that there were such throngs now that it was
hardly comfortable. Ralston insisted that he also must
pay his respects to Mrs. Madison, for now he could get
about on crutches, but it was not considered safe to bear
any great weight upon his injured limb as yet.
</p>

<p>
It was quite a fine scene, Stafford admitted. There was
a great variety in dress, the older men keeping to the Continental
style largely, with flowing frills to their shirt
fronts and lace ruffles at their wrists, velvet smallclothes
and silk stockings, and hair tied with a black ribbon or
fastened in a small silk bag.
</p>

<p>
Some of the younger men wore their hair curling over
their shoulders. There were gorgeous waistcoats, the
upper part flowered satin, and then a finishing of scarlet
that came halfway to the knee, the coats turned back and
faced with bright colors. Mrs. Madison was resplendent
in her red turban, with nodding ostrich plumes, and the
row of short black curls across her white forehead, and
her gown of cream satin, of so deep a tint as to be almost
yellow, with its abundant trimming of scarlet velvet.
</p>

<p>
Ralston was quite a hero for his misfortunes and his
counsels, which had averted some disaster and would have
saved much more if they had been followed. Everybody
could see the blunders and the supineness that had
really invited such a catastrophe. But peace had softened
many of the animadversions, and the charming sweetness
of the first lady of the land healed many differences.
It was true that the two later years of the administration
went far toward redeeming the mistakes of the earlier
part.
</p>

<p>
Annis had plead hard to go, but Jaqueline had not
thought it best.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_298' name='Page_298'>[298]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"You and Mr. Stafford will be sure to get in a quarrel,"
she said laughingly. "There will be plenty of levees for
you to attend when you are older. And the Octagon
House has not the room of the poor burned mansion. It
is always crowded."
</p>

<p>
Then Eustace Stafford said good-by with great grief to
the people he had come to fight, and found among them
the warmest of friends. He had not been alone in his experience.
</p>

<p>
Before Congress adjourned a bomb was thrown into
the camp. Since Washington was a heap of ruins and
would have to be rebuilt, why not remove it to some more
advantageous location?
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">ANNIS.</span>
</h2>

<p>
How near the Capital City came to be handed down
in history as Old Washington its denizens of to-day
will never know. There were many cogent reasons for
changing it. It had grown so slowly; it would require
an immense amount of money to rebuild it; the place
had never taken root in the affections of the whole
country.
</p>

<p>
But, then, it was the city of Washington and the old
worthies who had made the country. There was Florida
for the southern point, as well as Maine for the north-eastern;
there were the great Mississippi and Louisiana,
as well as the lake countries. Was it not nearly the
center?
</p>

<p>
Men like Arthur Jettson set about retrieving their fortunes
and showing their faith in the place. Mrs. Madison
made it as agreeable as possible to foreign ministers
and their wives, and guests from the more important
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_299' name='Page_299'>[299]</a></span>
cities. Colonel and Mrs. Monroe added to the attractions.
The Capitol was repaired slowly, but it was two
years before the White House was undertaken.
</p>

<p>
The scars were all healed long ago. The broad avenues
stretch out with handsome residences, and the
streets that little Annis thought so funny because they
were "like the A B C of the spelling book one way, and
the first lesson in the arithmetic the other way," have
filled up the vacant spaces with rows of houses. Tiber
Creek is no more, and Rock Creek, which rushed and
brawled and overflowed its banks in a freshet, is a dull
little meandering stream. Where the Lees and Custises
held sway and entertained in a princely manner there is
a grave, decorous silence and a City of Heroes, who, having
done their duty for liberty and country, sleep well
under the green turf. Georgetown has enlarged her borders,
and is beautiful. Mount Vernon, with its two hundred
years of history, is the nation's heritage. Old Washington
is almost forgotten, with here and there a relic
and a few old maps one can pore over in the grand Congressional
Library. And now it is indeed the City of
the Nation, with its many treasures, even if they are modern,
its handsome legations, its beautiful circles to commemorate
the heroes of later times. And Dolly Madison
lived to see many of the improvements, and to be the historic
link between the old and the new.
</p>

<p>
As for Annis Mason, she found it undeniably dull when
Eustace Stafford had gone. Even knowledge seemed to
lose its charm, and the babies grew commonplace. But,
then, in the spring Miss Polly and her lover were married
and set up a cozy little home of their own, and really
wanted Annis in it.
</p>

<p>
Then Varina came home&mdash;a tall, slim girl, quite vivacious
and ever so much better tempered than in her
youth; and really rather patronized Annis, who was not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_300' name='Page_300'>[300]</a></span>
a year younger, but quite a little girl, not come to trains
nor a great pile of hair on the top of her head, and a
cascade of puffs in front, and a comb so big it had to be
carried in a bag when you went out of an evening.
</p>

<p>
Then she had a lover, too&mdash;a fine young South Carolinian,
who had an immense plantation and no end of
slaves, and was going into the new industry of raising
cotton.
</p>

<p>
There was a very general demur. Varina was so
young, if she was tall. But, then, Southern girls grew up
soon, and many of them were wives at fifteen.
</p>

<p>
"There must be a year's engagement," her father said.
Varina must learn how to manage a household; and
girls had a good deal of instruction in housewifely arts in
those days, even if there was a regiment of slaves to do
everything.
</p>

<p>
"I'll coax off six months," Varina declared to her
lover, and he went away with that comfort.
</p>

<p>
She was surprised and amused at Annis' book-learning,
and teased her considerably. Did she mean to be a
schoolmistress?
</p>

<p>
Charles returned in capital health and spirits and full
of ambitious plans. He had not <i>quite</i> decided what he
would be, either a chief justice or a minister abroad. He
was not sure now that he wanted to be President.
</p>

<p>
"For people do say such dreadful things about you.
And you don't seem to suit anyone. I don't wonder Mr.
Madison looks old and thin and careworn."
</p>

<p>
"Do you remember," said Varina laughingly, "that
I used to oppose a marriage between you and Annis? I
wasn't going to let her have everything. I used to consider
that you belonged to me."
</p>

<p>
"You had a great way of appropriating everybody."
</p>

<p>
"What a ridiculous thing I was! And now I have
made up my mind that you are just suited to each other.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_301' name='Page_301'>[301]</a></span>
You can still sit on the window ledge and pore over the
same book."
</p>

<p>
"Annis is well enough, but I am sure she wouldn't
find Latin and Greek interesting. And by the time
I want to marry, Annis will be&mdash;well, quite an old
woman."
</p>

<p>
"If you don't marry until you are forty-nine she will
have turned the half-century. That would be rather old.
I shall be a grandmother before that time."
</p>

<p>
"All you girls think about is getting married," returned
the youth disdainfully.
</p>

<p>
"We think to some purpose, too, don't we? I wouldn't
be an old maid for a fortune!"
</p>

<p>
Annis was not sure she liked the defection on Charles'
part. He assumed a rather lofty air. Louis said he was
still a prig, that all the nonsense had not been knocked
out of him. But he was a very nice boy, for all that&mdash;gentlemanly,
refined, and extravagantly fond of his stepmother.
There were times when Annis felt inclined to
jealousy.
</p>

<p>
He was going to enter college at Williamsburg.
</p>

<p>
"It ought to make me proud of my own State, as well
as the whole country," he explained impressively to Annis.
"And then I shall go to Oxford maybe, or some of
the old English places that have the years of antiquity
back of them, and stand for all that is highest in knowledge,
that have romance and story and grandeur woven
into their very stones. Cloistered shades! Think how
beautiful they must be. And all the riches of Europe at
one's command!"
</p>

<p>
"If you like that kind of riches," disdainfully. "Wars
and bloodshed, rapine and cruelty, grasping and persecution&mdash;"
Annis paused, out of breath from indignation.
</p>

<p>
"That's like a girl! You can't distinguish between
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_302' name='Page_302'>[302]</a></span>
physical and intellectual progress. All nations have begun
on the low round. It is the capability of ascending
in the scale that gives them the real grandeur."
</p>

<p>
"I think they have not ascended very much in the
scale," returned Annis rather haughtily, the blackened
ruins of the beloved Washington and the day and night
of terror before her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"You are not capable of judging. It is what nations
have done in the aggregate. A thousand years have witnessed
marvels."
</p>

<p>
"Still, we haven't gone back to 'Solomon in all his
glory.' And Job, you know, had the names of the stars,
and understood almost everything."
</p>

<p>
She had been reading the book of Job aloud to her stepfather,
who was always interested in the historical parts
of the Bible.
</p>

<p>
"No one has really settled as to who Job was," said the
youth with calm superiority.
</p>

<p>
"Well, the knowledge is all there," returned Annis.
"Some day, thousands of years hence, someone may express
doubts about Columbus and John Smith and Washington,
but the country will be here."
</p>

<p>
Girls were not made for argument, and if you went
on forever they would have the last word, no matter how
inane it might be. Charles thought Annis much changed
for the worse, just like other girls, because she no longer
hung on his words and paid him a loving deference. Her
worship had been something new to the boy, for Varina
claimed by force, and was the superior power herself.
The others simply petted him. Annis understood and
appreciated. But he had outgrown the boyish fervor, and
she no longer paid homage to him.
</p>

<p>
He was too young to know that it was simply lack of
admiration, and vanity crying out with the wound.
</p>

<p>
Annis had quaffed the sweets of admiration herself.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_303' name='Page_303'>[303]</a></span>
A nature less fine and wholesome would have been spoiled
by the warm and fond approval of her brothers-in-law,
and the preference of others she had met. She was
coming to have the dawning self-appropriation of womanhood,
and no longer offered her choicest gifts, but felt they
must be sought with a certain humility. And there was
no humility at all about Charles at that period. They
were both too near parallel lines.
</p>

<p>
Yet it was a busy, happy, engrossing time. Varina
took possession of Louis, who was developing much of
his father's easy-going nature, but with the ambitions of
the new generation and the times; then, his associations
had been cast on different lines. It was whispered, too,
that a friend of Patty's with whom Annis was a great
favorite had cast a glamour over the young lawyer.
</p>

<p>
Annis solaced herself with the thought that Varina
would marry and go away, but all the others would be
left, and her dearly beloved Washington. Roger said
she would do for an archæologist, she was so fond of
exploring ruins. She insisted that Marian and Captain
Ralston should make pilgrimages to the little old hut
where he had so nearly died, and they found many marks
of the battle, that if it had been an ignominious rout, still
had in it the better part of valor, when the enemy were
overwhelming. Baltimore was glorying in her splendid
defense of Fort McHenry, and a girl who could not sing
"The Star-spangled Banner" was considered half a
Tory.
</p>

<p>
Though Annis was so young, hardly fifteen, she and
Varina had so many invitations to Washington that Mr.
Mason suggested they should engage board by the month.
Varina was making the best of her time, for she had
"coaxed off" six months of the engagement, and her
lover was to come soon after Christmas. In the spring
Louis was to set up a home of his own.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_304' name='Page_304'>[304]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Varina's marriage was in the old home, which was
crowded with relatives and guests. Her mother's wedding
gown did duty again, and then it went to Jaqueline
as an heirloom. Mr. Woodford was tall and really fine-looking,
with a good deal of character in his face, and of
good family, ten years older than Varina, which brought
him to the prime of young manhood.
</p>

<p>
"Really!" exclaimed Patty, "I do not see what remarkable
grace or virtue in Varina captured so substantial
and devoted a lover&mdash;though she <i>has</i> improved in
temper, and is better-looking; but she will never have
the Verney beauty&mdash;hardly the Mason. Well, one can't
explain half the queer happenings in this world."
</p>

<p>
Besides the cotton, Mr. Woodford had extensive rice
fields. Long ago rice had been brought from Madagascar.
In both the Carolinas many industries had been established.
Seventy years before, General Oglethorpe had
carried to England from Georgia eight pounds of silk
to be made into a dress for the queen. It was no wonder
England hated to lose her promising colonies.
</p>

<p>
Varina's marriage was extremely satisfactory. Patricia's
had been just a little shadowed by Jaqueline's broken
engagement, and the half-superstitious feeling that it
brought the best luck to the house for the eldest girl to
be married first. But Miss Jaqueline had her own true
lover after all, and was happy as a queen.
</p>

<p>
So Varina took her portion and the family blessing,
even that of Aunt Catharine, who was growing stout and
felt that she had the burden of half the world on her
shoulders, and William and Mary College thrown
in. She didn't see how anything could go on without
her.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps to feel of use is one of the great incentives to
earnest living.
</p>

<p>
"And you are to come and make me a long visit, Annis,"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_305' name='Page_305'>[305]</a></span>
Varina said cordially. "I shall be sorry for you,
left all alone here; and I'll write and tell you everything.
And there's Dolly, too, who has the gayest of gay times!
They are quite certain to nominate Cousin Preston for
representative next year. You see we are getting to be
rather famous people."
</p>

<p>
It was very lonely when they all went away. And now
Annis had her mother all to herself. No, <i>not</i> all&mdash;that
could never be again. For now that there were no children
whose future must be considered, and Charles had
planned out his own, Randolph Mason, who had always
been easy-going, dropped into the softened and indolent
ways of prosperous elderly life, and became his wife's
shadow.
</p>

<p>
True, his heart was large enough to take in Annis at
every step. But he had grown stout, and was not such
an enthusiastic horseman, though the yearly races inspired
all Virginians to keep some fine horses. He liked
the carriage better, with his wife beside him; and then
Annis was alone on the back seat. Of course he had the
best right, Annis recognized that.
</p>

<p>
She sewed and did drawn work and made lace, worked
embroidery in gold and silver thread, and helped with
her "fitting out."
</p>

<p>
"But if I should never marry?" she said to her
mother.
</p>

<p>
"Girls do, mostly," was the mother's quiet reply.
"And your father insists you shall have as much as the
other girls."
</p>

<p>
So there was spinning, and weaving in the loom room,
and bleaching to be considered in the spring, as May dew
was esteemed a wonderful whitener of linens and cottons,
though they were mostly woven in the Eastern
towns. Now and then came gossipy notes from Varina.
Charles wrote dutiful letters to his mother, and sent love
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_306' name='Page_306'>[306]</a></span>
to Annis. But the Washington households were begging
for Annis continually.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I would go," said her mother. "It is dull for
one girl alone here on the plantation."
</p>

<p>
"Mamma&mdash;don't <i>you</i> want me?" There was a lustrousness
like tears in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"My dear!" Her mother kissed her fondly. "Of
course I want you. But I have so many cares and occupations,
and father takes a good deal of my time, and
you have so few amusements. It is the difference, dear,
between young people and old people. I want your young
life to be pleasant."
</p>

<p>
"I wish we lived in Washington. Why can't papa
build on Virginia Avenue, and have a nice garden, and
keep horses, and&mdash;" What else was there for him to
do?
</p>

<p>
"He has become settled in this life. He was born and
reared here, and has his friends and neighbors about him.
It would make him unhappy to go away. The slaves are
all fond of him, and it is his pride to be a good master.
No; he couldn't leave everything. It is the young people
who go out and settle in new homes. And that is the way
the Lord has ordered it. 'For this cause'&mdash;that is, love&mdash;'shall
a man leave father and mother, and cleave unto his
wife.' And the wife does the same thing."
</p>

<p>
"Mamma," with a faint tint of color, "I do not think
I shall ever be married."
</p>

<p>
Her mother gave a soft little smile.
</p>

<p>
"You know Varina was always planning, and Patty
used to say 'When I am married,' but I feel curious, and&mdash;alone.
Perhaps I shall stay with you and father always,"
and she gave a tender little sigh. "Would you
want an old maid?"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps I shall need you to take care of me, as
grandma did Marian."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_307' name='Page_307'>[307]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"But I don't want you to die." She clasped her arms
about her mother's neck convulsively.
</p>

<p>
"Dear, that would give us thirty-odd years. And
grandmother was not a very old woman. A great many
things may happen in that time. I think you are a little
out of spirits and lonesome. You had better go up to
Jaqueline's to-morrow. Cato and Jim are going up with
a load. Cato can escort you, and they can take a portmanteau
in the wagon. Captain Ralston complains that
you have quite deserted him."
</p>

<p>
"And desert you!" half reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
"I shall have papa. Yes, little girlie, you must go
and have a nice time. I shall think of all the pleasure
you are enjoying. And we may come up for a few
days."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, mamma&mdash;if you will! It would be strange to
love anyone better than one's own mother."
</p>

<p>
But such things had been heard of in the history of
womankind.
</p>

<p>
Annis went up to her beloved Washington. Three
homes opened their hospitable doors, and Louis took her
to see his new house, just above the ruined pile that was
full of storied incident already.
</p>

<p>
"They are sure to rebuild it," he said. "There is a
grant being considered. We have had to fight against
considerable odds, but we shall keep our own Washington.
Forty or fifty years from this I shall be telling my grandchildren
how men flew to arms in her defense, whether
they were soldiers or not. And though the treaty has
omitted some things, we shall take them and keep them.
France is our good ally again. And John Quincy Adams
has gone to St. Petersburg to make friends of the Russians."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's the man Charles talks about, who went
abroad with his father when he was such a little lad, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_308' name='Page_308'>[308]</a></span>
had such a hard time, and studied and studied, and went
to Holland and everywhere."
</p>

<p>
"And is a fine diplomat. For a young country we
have raised a magnificent crop of men! I hope to be chief
justice myself some day."
</p>

<p>
"And not President?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll leave that for Charles. A chief justice is appointed
for life, and stands on his good behavior. Do
you think they will be likely to discharge me, Annis?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I know they won't!" laughingly.
</p>

<p>
The house was being built only to half of the plan.
The rest of the ground was to remain a garden until Louis
had increased in wealth. But it was very nice, with spacious
rooms. Miss Marcia Ellicot was something of an
heiress.
</p>

<p>
Annis found a difficulty in dividing herself around.
</p>

<p>
"There ought to be two or three of me," she said.
</p>

<p>
"And you are not to give me the cold shoulder," declared
Mrs. Jettson. "I do believe I was the first one
to take a real fancy to you; and do you remember how
Rene quarreled with you about the babies? Arthur and
Floyd are such big boys now."
</p>

<p>
A new boy had been added to the household. Babies
were warmly welcomed in those days.
</p>

<p>
She liked Marian's quiet home. Captain Ralston was
very fond of her. He had discarded his crutches, but still
used a cane.
</p>

<p>
"And what do you think, Annis?" he said, his eyes
alight with amusement. "I've had a letter from someone&mdash;just
guess!"
</p>

<p>
"You know so many people," returned Annis with a
curious heat in her cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"Someone you know, too. Your old enemy. My good
nurse and friend."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that&mdash;young Englishman who came over here
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_309' name='Page_309'>[309]</a></span>
to fight us," she answered with an indifferent air, though
she had been certain in her mind when he first told her to
guess.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; Stafford. He is coming over here to settle. He
was converted at the Battle of Bladensburg, and is a ranting,
tearing, out-and-out American. Why, you never
knew a more ardent patriot! He is going to take the oath
of allegiance at once, and find something to do, and do it
bravely, earnestly. That is the kind of citizens we want.
I think he has had something of a time to convince his
people, but his father has given him a small sum of money
to start him in life&mdash;nothing to what it would cost his
father if he stayed at home, he says. Strange how these
men keep their sons at home, thinking trade disgraceful,
when England would swoop up all the commerce of the
earth, forgetting what manner of men make commerce
possible."
</p>

<p>
Annis was silent, yet there was a little heart-beat of exultation.
Why she could not have told.
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;will you bid him welcome and Godspeed?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, it is nothing to me," with a pretty air of indifference.
</p>

<p>
She did not see the dainty flush on Marian's cheek, that
came in moments of embarrassment, as if she were still
sixteen.
</p>

<p>
"But, then, you have your country's good at heart?"
</p>

<p>
"I wish the country well," and she made a pretentious
courtesy, drawing up her brows.
</p>

<p>
Marian had read all the letter. It was proud and
manly, but a pretty girl had inspired a part of the resolve.
</p>

<p>
"I shall take him in hand. He is ready for work&mdash;if
he has a long line of ancestors with titles."
</p>

<p>
"Yes." Annis gave a provoking laugh. "You know
he does not like fighting."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_310' name='Page_310'>[310]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
There was pleasure enough to make her forget all about
him, but now and then she caught herself wondering.
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline was quite restored to health and beauty, and
was a favorite with society. Roger was certainly a rising
man. The undercurrent of political feeling was that
Mr. Monroe would succeed his chief, who would be quite
as glad to resign his honors and the flood of criticisms as
Mr. Jefferson had been. And though the conduct of the
war was caviled at, it was admitted on all sides that it
had raised the country in the rank of nations.
</p>

<p>
So Annis flitted back and forth like a dainty bird, that
did not forget the home nest. She did her hair high on
her head and had a fringe of fascinating little curls; she
wore French heels to her slippers, and a train on grand occasions.
She was not handsome, as the elder Mason girls
had been, not tall or stately, but sweet and pretty, with
just enough of the coquette to make her arch and winsome.
</p>

<p>
One night at an assembly, where naval men were out
in force, someone caught her hand in the change of partners.
A young officer, a first lieutenant, she saw by his
insignia of rank.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" he cried, "you have forgotten me, but I remember
you. I saw you across the room, but I was engaged
for this dance. I was coming immediately after. It was
at the naval ball when Ensign Hamilton came in with the
flag. What a night it was! And I was Midshipman
Yardley, going out on my first cruise. There&mdash;the next
figure is waiting."
</p>

<p>
He handed her gallantly to her new partner.
</p>

<p>
She went back to Jaqueline. "Oh, Roger!" she cried,
"do you remember the young midshipman at the naval
ball when there was such an excitement? He is here
to-night. I have just been dancing with him. There he
is, coming hither."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_311' name='Page_311'>[311]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The smiling young fellow was glad to see Mr. and
Mrs. Carrington. Annis excused herself from her next
partner, she was so eager to hear him talk. Perhaps he
would not have lent dignity to the position of an admiral,
for he was not tall nor imposing, but bright and eager
and full of spirit and ambition. "After all, it has been
a glorious war," he declared. He had been in a number
of victories, and quite distinguished himself, they heard
afterward; and one sad defeat, when he had been taken
prisoner with some other men and made a daring escape,
landing on the coast of France, and worked and begged
his way home. Now he was stationed at Annapolis for
some time.
</p>

<p>
Annis had to go and dance in the middle of the story,
and then he begged the honor. Was she staying with her
sister? He should be in town a few days. Could he not
call on her?
</p>

<p>
Jaqueline gave him the invitation.
</p>

<p>
Captain Ralston was eager to see him, as well. There
were so many things to talk over. Such wonderful victories,
some such sad defeats, many brave men who had
given their lives and left imperishable names behind them.
How proud the young fellow was of his country!
</p>

<p>
And they had to tell the story of Washington with the
<i>verve</i> that people do who have lived through an event.
</p>

<p>
They looked at the ruins, they rode up the Potomac,
they went again to Bladensburg. Everything was so
near, so vivid.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant Yardley decided that Annis was the most
charming young girl he had ever met.
</p>

<p>
"I am a little afraid of most women," he admitted.
"You can't always tell just what to say, and sometimes
when they praise you you feel silly all over. And some
women never rouse to patriotism. But <i>we</i> find so much
to say to each other. Oh, I wish I were going to stay in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_312' name='Page_312'>[312]</a></span>
Washington a month! Won't you make some of your
relatives bring you over to Annapolis? You have such a
splendid lot. Only, do you know, I like your own name,
Annis Bouvier, better than I do Annis Mason. It just
suits you."
</p>

<p>
She blushed a little. What a pretty way he had of saying
Annis!
</p>

<p>
But alas! the delight came to an end, and for several
days Annis thought Washington as dull as the plantation.
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid my poor fellow won't stand any chance,"
said Ralston, with a slow shake of the head. "The lieutenant
is delightful, certainly quite dangerous enough to
turn any girl's brain."
</p>

<p>
The "poor fellow" reached Washington one morning,
having landed at New York, and spent half a lifetime
on the post-roads, he declared. They were all a little
startled. It seemed as if he must have grown, he was so
tall and manly and fine-looking, and so overjoyed to see
them again, so happy at the thought of being an American
citizen.
</p>

<p>
"It is as I said when I was here before&mdash;the people do
not understand each other. When they come to a time
that they can work side by side in anything, you will see
something grand accomplished. There is a fine, free air
over here that inspirits one. You can begin without being
hampered by a thousand petty restrictions. And I
am going to prove myself a man."
</p>

<p>
Dr. Collaston and Patty gave him the warmest welcome,
quite as cordial as that of Ralston. But it was
queer that when he went there Annis had gone to Jaqueline's;
and finally Ralston asked her boldly to come to
tea and give Eustace Stafford a word of welcome.
</p>

<p>
"There isn't anything left for me to say," and the rosy
lips pouted as if offended. "You have all been so&mdash;so
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_313' name='Page_313'>[313]</a></span>
extravagant&mdash;or is it exuberant?&mdash;in your demonstrations,
that I shall seem tame. And why should I be so
desperately glad? He would have killed you, Philip,
or anyone else, if he hadn't been wounded at once. I'd
like you to go and thank the soldier who did it."
</p>

<p>
"You are a briery little body where he is concerned,
Annis. Why, peace would never have been signed if both
parties had held out as you do! I think it fine in him to
come out so frankly and own he was on the wrong side.
Even if you have no Indian blood in your veins, you might
come and smoke a figurative pipe of peace&mdash;that is, drink
a cup of tea and wish him well."
</p>

<p>
"You know I don't like tea. I should think they
would have wanted to throw it overboard. Another of
England's tyrannies!"
</p>

<p>
"I thought you had a tender place in your heart for
Marian and me."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I can come!" she said pettishly. "I am not
afraid of your Englishman."
</p>

<p>
"I began to think you were," teasingly.
</p>

<p>
And so she came. But when she greeted Mr. Stafford,
who had nothing of the boy left about him, but who met
her eyes steadily until hers fell, and whose voice had lost
the old deprecating, beseeching tone, a sudden half-terror
took possession of her, an indefinable fear that made her
angry and yet disarmed her. Oh, she was sure she liked
Lieutenant Yardley a hundred times better!
</p>

<p>
Afterward she said she was tired of all the gayeties,
and wanted to go home. The plantation was at its loveliest,
and there would be such rides with papa, and she
was sure her mother was longing to see her.
</p>

<p>
But when bees once get a taste for the sweetest honey
flowers, they haunt the spot. And Annis Bouvier was
no longer a little girl. She felt the strange solemn capabilities
within her. Sometimes she clung to her mother,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_314' name='Page_314'>[314]</a></span>
as if not daring to meet them. The mother knew what it
meant, and gave her the wordless comfort mothers can
give, in a kiss or a clasp of the hand, as one crosses the
bridge to womanhood.
</p>

<p>
Neighboring young men began to haunt the house.
The Mason girls had always been favorites. And then
down came the young Englishman, who resolved not to
lose the prize if earnest wooing could avail. They were
both so young. True, he had his fortune to make, but
some of the noblest Virginian families had sprung from
penniless young sons who had come to the new countries
and won not only wealth, but fame. Captain Ralston
had found a place for him, and he should live in fair
sight of everybody. If he did not make the sort of man
they could approve, he should never blame them for refusing
him their treasure. All he asked for was time and
a fair field.
</p>

<p>
"He has the making of a man in him," the father conceded
to himself, but aloud he said&mdash;a little weakly:
"Annis is too young to decide. In the end it will be as
she desires."
</p>

<p>
"And I can come now and then as a friend?"
</p>

<p>
"It may make trouble for Annis later on, but I could
not refuse," he said to his wife afterward.
</p>

<p>
Annis came and sat on his knee in the soft Virginian
twilight, dusky sooner than that farther north. The
whip-poor-wills called to each other, the mocking bird
flung out a note now and then as if he said saucily, "<i>Did</i>
you think I was asleep?" and the frogs in the marsh were
far enough off to send a strain of quivering music. She
put her arms about his neck, and her soft warm cheek
touched his.
</p>

<p>
"Were you very cross and stern, papa?" in the most
coaxing of tones.
</p>

<p>
"No, dear. He is a fine fellow."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_315' name='Page_315'>[315]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"But he came to fight against us."
</p>

<p>
"Yes. It was a great crime."
</p>

<p>
"He was sent, and he didn't know any better. Some
day we shall know a good deal more about each other."
</p>

<p>
"Annis, do you love him? Child, don't make a mistake!
And don't trifle with him."
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't <i>love</i> him. We quarreled dreadfully at
first. I can't help liking and admiring him. He is so
strong and earnest. There are a good many grand men
in the world, are there not? And some of them have
been poor and have had hard times. I didn't want him
to think it was because he was poor."
</p>

<p>
"No, dear," as she waited for some reply.
</p>

<p>
"And you know I can't help meeting him at Marian's,
and Patty likes him so much, too. It would be very disagreeable
to be bad friends?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," assented the elder.
</p>

<p>
"So we are going to be <i>just</i> friends until&mdash;well, until I
am twenty, perhaps."
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;if you will wait until then."
</p>

<p>
Annis kissed him.
</p>

<p>
But that was not the end of love affairs. Lieutenant
Yardley insisted upon telling his story. He had carried
about with him a child's sweet face, and resolved that if
he should survive the deadly strife he would come home
and find her. He thought his claim far the best. Had
he not fought for the country, <i>her</i> country?
</p>

<p>
She liked him too. It was hard to decide. And then
the lieutenant, being rather fiery, went at his rival in a
fierce manner. Dueling was still in vogue.
</p>

<p>
Annis was alarmed. She sent for the big Englishman.
It was curious, but she knew she could make him obey
her slightest behest, big and strong as he was.
</p>

<p>
"You are not to quarrel about me," she began with
wonderful dignity. "I do not think I shall marry either
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_316' name='Page_316'>[316]</a></span>
of you, or anybody. But if there <i>was</i> a dispute, and you
did anything reprehensible, I should never, <i>never</i> see you
or speak to you again. Lieutenant Yardley is one of the
country's heroes, and you&mdash;" How should she put it?
</p>

<p>
"I am here on sufferance, until I earn the right. Yes,
I understand."
</p>

<p>
She flushed scarlet.
</p>

<p>
"You are bound over to keep the peace."
</p>

<p>
"Here is my hand in token of it. I shall never do anything
to make you sorry or ashamed of me."
</p>

<p>
"Papa," she said in a plaintive tone a day or two after
Stafford's visit, "should you be very sorry if I&mdash;were to&mdash;stay
single&mdash;always?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, no, dear," and he smiled. "Don't you remember,
when Louis and Charles used to dispute about you, I
said we would marry off the others, and you should stay
here with mother and me?"
</p>

<p>
"I must be very naughty, to have people disputing
about me," and she sighed in a delicious sort of manner.
"But I have quite resolved that I will not marry anybody."
</p>

<p>
They all went up to Washington to attend the wedding
of the eldest son. There was only one lover present, and
Annis was sincerely glad.
</p>

<p>
There was much going back and forth, as there always
is when families branch out and set up new homes. And
presently Charles came home, quite a tall boy, but still
delicate-looking, and so much improved that Annis insensibly
went back to her old regard for him. He
was broader-minded, and took a livelier interest in
everything.
</p>

<p>
He soon found that Annis was a great favorite with all
the young people. She wasn't as handsome as Jaqueline,
nor as bright and overflowing with fun as Patty; indeed,
he could not decide what the charm was. He heard about
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_317' name='Page_317'>[317]</a></span>
the two real lovers, and met them both. Secretly he favored
Stafford and felt sorry for the lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
One day they were lounging in the old nook by the
creek. He was telling over his plans. He was not anxious
now to be President, or even a minister abroad, but
he was eager for all the knowledge he could grasp, for
all the discoveries that were looming up on the horizon.
Uncle Conway had advised him to enter an English university
after the coming year.
</p>

<p>
She was in the low swing, which was a tangle of vines
now, and he was curled up in the grass at her feet, as they
talked over the past and the future. Then there was a
long, sweet silence, such as comes nowhere but in country
nooks.
</p>

<p>
"Annis," he exclaimed regretfully, resignedly, "I do
not suppose you ever could marry me?"
</p>

<p>
She started in surprise. "Oh, Charles!" she cried in
pain, "I thought that foolishness was at an end."
</p>

<p>
"Has it been foolishness? Annis, I don't believe you
could understand that boyish passion. I don't understand
it myself. You fitted into my life. You liked my
old heroes. You never laughed or teased me about them.
They were my life then. That was the country I always
lived in. And it was very sweet to have you. How jealous
I was of Louis! Some of the great intellectual heroes
have had just such a love. Last summer I was half
ashamed of it; I was growing out of childhood. And
now I have gone back to it again."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Charles, I am so sorry!" There was anguish in
her tone. "You see, I am older, and you will have four
or five years abroad, and grow and develop as men
do&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes. I couldn't ask so much of you. And maybe,
then, we wouldn't suit. Don't you know how the old
slave women put pieces of gowns in their best quilts and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_318' name='Page_318'>[318]</a></span>
cherish them because this was young missy's, and this
someone else's? And I'd like to be the piece that you'd
go back to in memory, and think how sweet the old times
were, even when you have a husband, proud and strong,
and that you loved devotedly. And how you bade me hope
through all that trying time, and gave me your mother
when you loved her so, and kept my little secret, for we
never can think it was Varina's fault."
</p>

<p>
She bent over. Their arms were about each other's
necks, and both were crying&mdash;tender, loving tears.
</p>

<p>
The ensuing winter in Washington was one long talked
about. The President removed to a place forming part
of the notable "Seven Buildings," which had been fitted
up for its greater spaciousness. It was the last winter of
Mrs. Madison's reign, as in March Colonel Monroe was
to be inaugurated. There was a great stir and intellectual
activity, a broadening of political life; and as we look
back it seems as if there were giants in those days.
Thither came the hero of the Battle of New Orleans, General
Jackson, with his wife, and many another worthy;
even curious visitors from abroad, who acknowledged the
grace of Mrs. Madison's brilliant hospitality.
</p>

<p>
Thenceforward it was to be a new Washington, more
truly American perhaps, crystallizing around the points
that gave strength and dignity, and proving false many an
evil prophecy.
</p>

<p>
A few, very few, of the old places are left. But the
Capitol is the nucleus of a great nation, and the White
House reared on the old superstructure holds many memories
the country will always cherish.
</p>

<p>
I suppose I hardly need tell you that after a while Annis
broke her resolve and married the man of her choice,
living a long and happy life in the newer Washington.
That when her sons were grown there was nothing they
enjoyed more than visiting the commander at Fortress
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_319' name='Page_319'>[319]</a></span>
Monroe and listening to the stirring events of 1812. He
thought there never could be such battles and victories
again. But the girls were most fond of their delightful
bachelor uncle Charles, whose pen was making a name
and fame in the intellectual world.
